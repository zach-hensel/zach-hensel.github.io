title: Posters presented at SMLMS
---
Ruilan and Zach presented posters at the [Single-Molecule Localization Microscopy Symposium](https://2024.smlms.org/) in Lisbon. Ruilan presented her work building on our recently updated preprint on studying an *M. tuberculosis* protein-protein interaction in the context of *E. coli* cells in order to observe the two proteins without other Mtb cell division proteins. Zach presented a summary of our progress towards efficiently counting single mRNAs as they are transcribed and quantifying transcription elongation rates for single mRNAs. This included Margarida Perreira's work in her undergraduate research project in the lab testing whether newly reported fluorescent proteins mStayGold and mBaoJin improved upon mNeonGreen for mRNA imaging.
