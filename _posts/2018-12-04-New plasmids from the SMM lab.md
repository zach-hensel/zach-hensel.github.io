title: New plasmids for low-noise gene expression at AddGene
---

New plasmids from the lab are now available at AddGene. First, a [collection of plasmids for RNA imaging](https://www.addgene.org/browse/article/28196731/) in E. coli using the coat protein from the bacteriophage PP7 fused to different fluorescent proteins. These are based on work from a few papers from [Robert Singer's lab](https://www.einstein.yu.edu/labs/robert-singer/), and make it possible to observe single RNAs containing tandem repeats of a specific sequence with either a cyan or red fluorescent protein. Second, [plasmids from Jo√£o Silva's Masters project](https://www.addgene.org/browse/article/28196736/) are available for low-noise gene expression. See more information on those in this Twitter thread:
