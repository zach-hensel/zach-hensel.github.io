title: New manuscript posted to bioRxiv
---

Congratulations to Jo√£o Silva and everyone else in the lab who contributed to the first manuscript arising from his masters work. The manuscript, "Plasmids for independently tunable, low-noise expression of two genes," is now available on [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2019/01/09/515940). We characterized new plasmids that can be combined to tune the expression of two different genes in *E. coli*, and we discuss how these plasmids can be used to improve a variety of microbiology experiments. We also showed some data for single-molecule mRNA detection using the bacteriophage PP7 coat protein. The figure below shows how we can use this system to change the expression levels of GFP and mScarlet-I independently.

The manuscript was written using [Manubot](https://greenelab.github.io/meta-review/), a revolutionary tool for composing scientific manuscripts online.
