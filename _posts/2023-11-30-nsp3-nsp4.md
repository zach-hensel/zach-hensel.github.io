title: Structure predictions contribute to understanding the SARS2 double-membrane vesicle pore
---

Work led by Liv Zimmermann and Petr Chlanda was recently published in Nature Communications: [SARS-CoV-2 nsp3 and nsp4 are minimal constituents of a pore spanning replication organelle](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-43666-5). The work used cryo-electron tomography to find that cells expressing only SARS2 non-structural proteins nsp3 and nsp4 produced hexameric pores decorating double-membrane vesicles (DMV). Previously, expression of IBV nsp4 alone [was found to induce membrane pairing](https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/10/9/477) and nsp6 was considered to be a likely possible constituent of [DMV pores in MHV- and SARS2-infected cells](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abd3629).

Our lab's contribution to the paper incorporated results from our preprint that was the first report of the [Predicted binding interface between coronavirus nsp3 and nsp4](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.03.05.483145v1) which has yet to be confirmed experimentally, yet is consistent with a mutations known to disrupt nsp4 and sequence conservation during the SARS2 pandemic. Predicted structures and molecular dynamics helped interpret Cryo-ET data that lacked resolution in the DMV lumen compared to the hexameric nsp3 crown of the DMV pore.
