title: Congratulations to João Silva on finishing his thesis
---

Congrats to João Silva submitted his thesis today on "Engineering low-noise gene expression systems for single-molecule experiments". João developed new gene-expression plasmids that are compatible with ones that we [previously reported](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0187259). He showed that LacI/IPTG can work just as well as TetR/tetracycline, and that the systems can be moved to a compatible plasmid backbone with lower copy number. The plasmids are on their way to AddGene. The image shows how expression can be tuned to have low noise with only a few hundred molecules per cell in order to see spots that are labeled with a couple dozen molecules above background.
