---

Congrats and good luck to Teresa Carvalho and Ricardo Quiteres who submitted their Masters theses in the last two months and will be defending in the next month! Teresa studied how bacterial effectors influence actin filamentation with a combination of *in vitro* and *in vivo* approaches (pictured left) and Ricardo studied intermediate filament defects associated with a neurodegenerative disorder by superresolution microscopy (pictured right).
