title: New paper published in mSphere
---

João Silva's Masters research culimated in a paper published in mSphere today: [Plasmids for Independently Tunable, Low-Noise Expression of Two Genes](https://doi.org/10.1128/mSphere.00340-19). The paper reports the development and characterization of two compatible plasmids that we co-transformed into E. coli to independently induce GFP (GFPmut2) and RFP (mScarlet-I) expression. Together with Soraia Lopes and Diogo Grilo in the lab, we also showed how the new IPTG-inducible plasmid that João created can be used for imaging single mRNA molecules.
