title: Sara Costa defends her thesis on cell division and elongation
---

Congratulations to Sara Costa, who defended her thesis and was awarded her PhD today. In Sara's thesis, *New approaches to study Staphlococcus aureus elongation and division*, she discusses work implementing fluorescence microscopy techniques for studying protein-protein interaction in *S. aureus* and reports identifying GpsB as a non-essential protein that impacts cell elongation in *S. aureus* -- this work is [preprinted at biorxiv](https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.06.16.545294) and was overseen by Sara's co-supervisor, [Mariana Pinho](https://www.itqb.unl.pt/labs/bacterial-cell-biology).

This only scratches the surface of the work covered during Sara's PhD. She also played an essential role in our [investigation of the *E. coli* divisome](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39921-4) and in single-molecule imaging of transcription elongation in *E. coli*.
