We've upgraded our microscopy setup to add LED illumination and allow for rapid modulation of 5 laser lines using [Micro-Manager](https://micro-manager.org/). Plans to reproduce what we've built are available at the [github repo](https://github.com/zach-hensel/lasers-and-brightfield).

Our design builds on several other free/open components that are described in github readme.
