title: Light up your lab with fluorescent protein LEDs
---

It's that time of year, so the Single Molecule Microbiology lab (Zach Hensel, Sara Costa and Cleusia Manuel) got together and designed and 3d-printed holiday lights based on the x-ray structure of the GFP variant mTurquoise2.

If you want to do the same for your own lab, check out our design and design tips at our [github repository](https://github.com/smmlab/3d-printing/tree/master/mtq2%20lights). For a more practical application of 3d printing, you'll also find new designs that summer student Joana Val√©rio made for a linear stage for positioning our sCMOS camera at [this repository](https://github.com/smmlab/3d-printing/tree/master/prime95b_mount).
