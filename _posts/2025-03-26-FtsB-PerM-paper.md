title: Paper out on mycobacterial cell division
---

Work from our lab by JoÃ£o Ramalheira Ferreira, Ruilan Xu, and Zach Hensel is [available online today](https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/jb.00444-24) in *Journal of Bacteriology*!

> Our research reveals significant insights into the dynamic interaction between the proteins PerM and FtsB within Mycobacterium tuberculosis, contributing to our understanding of bacterial cell division mechanisms crucial for infection persistence. By combining innovative fluorescence microscopy and molecular dynamics, we established that the stability of these proteins is interdependent; molecular dynamics placing PerM-FtsB in the context of the mycobacterial divisome shows how disrupting PerM-FtsB interactions can plausibly impact bacterial cell wall synthesis. These findings highlight the PerM-FtsB interface as a promising target for novel therapeutics aimed at combating persistent bacterial infections. Importantly, our approach can be adapted for similar studies in other bacterial systems, suggesting broad implications for microbial biology and antibiotic development.
