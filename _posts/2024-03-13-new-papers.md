title: Recent work published from our lab
---
We've updated the [research page](/research) to include updates on new preprints frkom our lab and in collaboration with other labs. Congrats to João and Ruilan for their work on the new preprint: [Mycobacterium tuberculosis FtsB and PerM interact via a C-terminal helix in FtsB to modulate cell division](https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.03.11.584518). Congrats to lab alumnus Sara Costa as well for her paper from Mariana Pinho's lab published last month: [The role of GpsB in Staphylococcus aureus cell morphogenesis](https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.03235-23)

We've also got two preprints out on SARS-CoV-2 related topics. First, with Florence Débarre, we found that [stories about deleted viral sequences](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/23/science/coronavirus-sequences.html) from June 2021 were not at all consistent with data available at the time. Read about it in the preprint: [A critical reexamination of recovered SARS-CoV-2 sequencing data](https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.02.15.580500). We also published a very short preprint regarding the surprising observation that mutation rates in SARS-CoV-2 during the pandemic are strongly correlated with RNA basepairing. It will be interesting to see how this can be incorporated into models predicting the impact of mutations. Read the preprint here:  [Secondary structure of the SARS-CoV-2 genome is predictive of nucleotide substitution frequency](https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.02.27.581995).
