title: Goodbye to Soraia Lopes
---

After almost a year and a half, Soraia's time in our lab came to an end this week. She was instrumental in getting the lab off the ground and contributed to many on-going projects in RNA detection. She's off to work in regenerative medicine approaches to ALS treatment!
