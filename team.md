## Current team members

### Zach Hensel (head of lab)

[zach.hensel@itqb.unl.pt](mailto:zach.hensel@itqb.unl.pt) | Phone (+351) 214-469-724 | [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.pt/citations?user=QwsENLQAAAAJ&hl=en) 

![Zach](img/zach.jpg){: .image-left } I came to the lab after doing postdoctoral work at the [Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology](https://www.oist.jp/). I've worked on single-protein imaging (mostly using components from bacteriophage λ) since my PhD work with [Jie Xiao](http://xiao.med.jhmi.edu/). Now I am interested in expanding that work to image mRNA and protein at the same time for a single gene (ultimately, for more than one gene), employing these techniques in living biofilms, and investigating molecular mechanisms of gene regulation. A more recent interest is to combine advances in the prediction of the structure of proteins and complexes of proteins with fluorescence microscopy experiments to try to piece together puzzles in regulation of microbial cell biology such as the response to the host-cell environment.

I advocated for open research initiatives (especially preprint) with [ASAPbio](http://asapbio.org/asapbio-ambassadors) and previously with [eLife](https://elifesciences.org/inside-elife/912b0679/early-career-advisory-group-elife-welcomes-150-ambassadors-of-good-practice-in-science). Check out the [ITQB preprint journal club](preprintjc).

### Ruilan Xu, MSc (post-Masters research fellowship)

Ruilan studied biology at [Jinan University](https://english.jnu.edu.cn/) in China, where she says that she became fascinated with exploring the microbial world, leading her to complete Master's thesis in microbiology at Stockholm University in Sweden. Ruilan's current research interest is the study of infectious pathogens, such as *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*. In her fellowship, she is expanding her expertise in microscopy methods to study protein-protein interactions with single-molecule tracking, and she also brings her experience in mycobacterial cell culture to the lab.

During her spare time, Ruilan enjoys visiting museums to learn more about cultures around the world or about specific subjects such as toy, chocolate, or game museums. Additionally, she likes singing and dancing, and says, "music serves as the perfect remedy for weariness in my life."

## Alumni

### PhD students

* Sara Costa, PhD (ITQB NOVA, [MolBioS](http://www.itqb.unl.pt/education/phd-molecular-bioscience), 2023). Thesis: *New approaches to study Staphlococcus aureus elongation and division*.\
Sara graduated in Biology (Molecular Biology and Genetics) from Faculty of Sciences, University of Lisbon and then attended a Masters program in Molecular Genetics and Biomedicine at Faculty of Science and Technology at NOVA University Lisbon. Her main scientific interest is to study the role of gene expression regulation in controlling cell division in *Staphylococcus aureus*.
