![Zach](img/zach.jpg)

I came to the lab after doing postdoctoral work at the [Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology](https://www.oist.jp/). I've worked on single-protein imaging (mostly using components from bacteriophage Î») since my PhD work with [Jie Xiao](http://xiao.med.jhmi.edu/). Now I am interested in expanding that work to image mRNA and protein at the same time for a single gene (ultimately, for more than one gene), employing these techniques in living biofilms, and investigating molecular mechanisms of gene regulation.

I am an advocate for open research initiatives (especially preprint) through affiliations with interest groups at [ASAPbio](http://asapbio.org/asapbio-ambassadors) and [eLife](https://elifesciences.org/inside-elife/912b0679/early-career-advisory-group-elife-welcomes-150-ambassadors-of-good-practice-in-science). I run the [ITQB preprint journal club](https://www.prereview.org/users/172741/articles/210868-itqb-preprint-journal-club-9-nov-2017).
