![Zach](img/zach.jpg){: .image-left } I came to the lab after doing postdoctoral work at the [Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology](https://www.oist.jp/). I've worked on single-protein imaging (mostly using components from bacteriophage λ) since my PhD work with [Jie Xiao](http://xiao.med.jhmi.edu/). Now I am interested in expanding that work to image mRNA and protein at the same time for a single gene (ultimately, for more than one gene), employing these techniques in living biofilms, and investigating molecular mechanisms of gene regulation.

I am an advocate for open research initiatives (especially preprint) as an ambassador for interest groups affiliated with [ASAPbio](http://asapbio.org/asapbio-ambassadors) and [eLife](https://elifesciences.org/inside-elife/912b0679/early-career-advisory-group-elife-welcomes-150-ambassadors-of-good-practice-in-science). I run the [ITQB preprint journal club](preprintjc).

### Sara Costa ([MolBioS](http://www.itqb.unl.pt/education/phd-molecular-bioscience) PhD Student)

Sara graduated in Biology (Molecular Biology and Genetics) from Faculty of Sciences, University of Lisbon and then attended a Masters program in Molecular Genetics and Biomedicine at Faculty of Science and Technology at NOVA University Lisbon. Her main scientific interest is to study the role of gene expression regulation in controlling cell division in *Staphylococcus aureus*.

### Soraia Lopes (post-masters research fellow)

Soraia graduated in Biology (Molecular Biology and Genetics) from Faculty of Sciences, University of Lisbon and then attended a Masters program in Biotechnology and Bioengineering at School of Biosciences, University of Kent. Her main scientific interest is to study RNA and protein imaging *in vivo* using different RNA labelling systems in *E. coli*.
