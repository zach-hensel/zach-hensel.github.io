## ITQB Preprint Journal Club

Isn't it frustrating to know that the papers you are reading often describe work finished over a year ago? Biologists are rapidly adopting preprint to address this problem (we're trying some things to speed up publication, too). But how do we know whether results in the preprint literature are trustworthy? That's where [preprint journal clubs](http://asapbio.org/preprint-journal-clubs) can play a role. At meetings, we discuss recent preprints and, when it would be beneficial, publish reviews and/or contact preprint authors with feedback on the work. We are helping to beta test some of the resources put together by [PREreview](https://www.prereview.org/) for publishing reviews.

Please contact [Zach](mailto:zach.hensel@itqb.unl.pt) if you want to volunteer to present at the preprint journal club or be added to the mailing list to be notified about future meetings.

### 21 September 2018

**[A tunable dual-input system for 'on-demand' dynamic gene expression regulation](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/09/16/404699)
This article was presented by Dr. Federico Herrera, who was interested in a new technique to manipulate the sorts of cells he works with in a more rapid and tunable way. Check out the [preprint review](https://www.prereview.org/users/172741/articles/326353-itqb-preprint-journal-club-21-september-2018)!

### 3 July 2018

**[Cell boundary confinement sets the size and position of the E. coli chromosome](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/06/15/348052)**

Dr. Ambre Jousselin led the discussion of this article, with assistance from [Dr. Manuel Melo](http://www.itqb.unl.pt/labs/multiscale-modeling/). Check out the [preprint review](https://www.prereview.org/users/172741/articles/312262-itqb-preprint-journal-club-3-july-2018)!

### 24 May 2018

**[Active degradation of a regulator controls coordination of downstream genes](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/02/26/272120)**

Zach Hensel led the discussion of this article, summarizing the peer reviews solicited for [biOverlay](https://www.bioverlay.org/post/2018-05-active-degradation-coordination/). What is biOverlay? It's a curated journal of articles (mostly preprints) that the editors of biOverlay think deserve wider attention and/or scrutiny. We solicit peer reviews and publish them alongside our own summary of the paper. This informs the research community about new research, provides feedback to preprint publishers, and potentially provides information that can be useful for journals in selecting articles for publication or substituting for part of the traditional peer review process.

### 11 Dec 2017

**[Atypical domain communication and domain functions of a Hsp110 chaperone](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/11/17/220798)**  
[Alvaro Crevenna](http://www.itqb.unl.pt/research/biological-chemistry/biomolecular-self-organization) led the discussion, with assistance of interpreting SAXS data from [Tiago Cordeiro](http://www.itqb.unl.pt/research/biological-chemistry/dynamic-structural-biology)


### 9 Nov 2017

**[Metabolic Interactions Between Dynamic Bacterial Subpopulations](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/10/25/208686)**  
Feedback from the journal club was incorporated into a [preprint review](https://www.prereview.org/users/172741/articles/210868-itqb-preprint-journal-club-9-nov-2017) by Zach Hensel.
