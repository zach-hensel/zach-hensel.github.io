## Bem vindo!

Welcome to our lab! We are part of the [MostMicro](http://www.itqb.unl.pt/mostmicro) research unit at [ITQB NOVA](http://www.itqb.unl.pt/), an institute of [Universidade NOVA de Lisboa](http://www.unl.pt/). The lab started in January 2017.

## Mission Statement

Our lab answers questions in microbial molecular biology, with a methodological focus on single-molecule fluorescence microscopy in living cells. By detecting, tracking and counting individual DNA, mRNA and protein molecules, we will learn how to make better synthetic genetic circuits, how gene expression is regulated, and how cells interact with each other, other organisms, and their environments. We are especially interested in how single-cells evolve over time: our experiments complement modern high-resolution and high-throughput approaches that look at single time points. We closely follow developments in microscopy (especially emerging 3D imaging techniques) and fluorescent labeling. The lab embraces the open science revolution, with strong preferences for open access publication, data/code availability, and preprint.

## Current work

Check out our most recent paper on a new [low-noise gene expression system](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0187259) in E. coli ([plasmids available at AddGene](https://www.addgene.org/Zach_Hensel/)). We developed this to facilitate single-molecule experiments with fluorescent proteins that require very low expression levels with very low cell-to-cell variation. Browse the [research](research.md) page for details about our other projects.

We are using this system to develop and improve methods for live-cell mRNA imaging.
