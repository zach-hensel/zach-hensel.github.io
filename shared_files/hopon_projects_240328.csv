ulTRafast hOlograPHic FTIR microscopY	Many human pathologies such as cancer are due to complex biochemical alterations that start at a sub-cellular level and lead to progressive changes that result in a heterogeneous tumor composition. The polyclonality of tumor cells hampers the diagnosis and the therapy giving rise to tumor clones that lead to therapy resistance and promote metastases. An accurate diagnosis of tumor biopsies to identify these particular cell clones is crucial to provide targeted therapy tailored to the tumor characteristics, to improve the patient outcomes and increase survival rates. For this vision to come true, we introduce ulTRafast hOlograPHic FT-IR microscopY (TROPHY) as a paradigm shift in vibrational microscopy, blending elements of photo-thermal infrared (PT-IR), Fourier transform (FT)-IR, and Digital Holography Microscopy (DHM). TROPHY brings these techniques to the unprecedented ultrafast timescale, where the refractive index change induced by coherent IR vibrations is probed at its peak value before thermal relaxation. TROPHY borrows from PT-IR the combination of IR vibrational excitation with visible probing for high spatial resolution, from FT-IR the use of time-domain interferometry to obtain a high spectral resolution from broadband excitation, from DHM highly sensitive and quantitative detection of the refractive index (phase) change. Combined with artificial intelligence algorithms, this technology will enable quantitative concentration imaging of molecular biomarkers with high spatial resolution, high chemical selectivity and high speed, with a transformative impact on medical research and clinics. In oncology, it will be applied to intraoperative diagnosis of tumor biopsies, providing tumor grading, staging and subtyping, and supporting complete tumor resection. It will also allow to determine the best therapeutic approach tailored to the patient and identify resistant tumor clones under targeted therapy, paving the way for precision medicine in cancer.

regeNerAtive Resilient smaRt mAnufacTuring nEtworks	"Manufacturing and logistics companies are subject to unforeseen events that disrupt the supply chain, causing production slowdowns, reduced output, and increased costs, making it difficult to meet customer demand. To mitigate these risks, manufacturers must build resilience across entire value chains. 
NARRATE will develop a sophisticated tool using AI, Digital Twin, and IoT technologies allowing end-to-end visibility and control over supply chain operations to monitor and predict potential disruptions, enabling supply chains to achieve improved resilience. 
The Intelligent Manufacturing Custodian (IMC) will leverage data from various production sources to enable proactive decision-making and act as a nerve centre for a supply-chain network, providing real-time monitoring and coordination of intelligent production processes and logistics. Integrating an IMC into a supply-chain will evolve its operations into Smart Manufacturing Network (SMN): a connected and self-orchestrated ecosystem linked end-to-end with programmable Manufacturing-as-a-Service capabilities that can withstand disruptions.
A Digital Twin will provide a reliable model to represent production and operational data of an SMN to unlock deeper IMC intelligence. Collected data will train machine learning models to predict potential disruptions, such as natural disasters or delayed shipments. AI algorithms will analyse the data and provide real-time reporting and visualization on a dashboard. 
The IMC and Digital Twin interaction will generate powerful insights and self-adapting abilities that support an SMN to evolve under human supervision by switching services between multiple external partners to respond to risks and disruptions and improve energy efficiency, product circularity and environmental sustainability across the entire production process.
The effectiveness of NARRATE will be evaluated by testing the IMC in real production environments in quite diverse industry sectors."	supply chain resilience; Manufacturing as a service; digital twins; Artificial intelligence, IoT; data contextualisation; Smart Manufacturing Network; AI Platform; disruption and risk detection	INSTITUTO TECNOLOGICO METALMECANICO, MUEBLE, MADERA, EMBALAJE Y AFINES-AIDIMME - AIDIMME	BUDATEC GMBH -; DHL EXEL SUPPLY CHAIN SPAIN SL - DHL SUPPLY CHAIN	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101138094/program/43108390/details	
iodine Fed Advanced Cusp field Thruster for Mid-Power	iFACT-MP (iodine Fed Advanced Cusp field Thruster for Mid-Power) aims to develop an iodine fed thruster subsystem for the 3-5 kW range. The activity will include work on all the critical building blocks required to enable the realisation of an iodine EP subsystem. This encompasses the upscaling of the Advanced Cusp Field Thruster (ACFT) to that power range at Airbus Friedrichshafen and the development of the fluidic chain at Airbus Toulouse, consisting of the heated iodine reservoir, piping and flow control for the thruster as well as the neutraliser. Further, the necessary verification and formalisation of the fluidic design and iodine handling procedures will be performed to enable the implementation and integration of iodine EP subsystems on platform level. A major building block required to enable a completely iodine based EP chain is an iodine fed neutraliser. For this purpose, further improvements and modifications on C12A7 emitter ceramics will be performed by Fraunhofer IKTS, in close collaboration with the iodine cathode development at Airbus. To validate the necessary control and operational schemes, a breadboard PPU will be developed by Airbus Elancourt that includes all the required supplies, telemetry and functionalities to enable autonomous control of the thruster subsystem. To enable rapid and accurate characterisation of the developed thruster subsystem's performance, an optical iodine flow meter will be developed and integrated by University of Pisa. As currently no test facility exists to perform thruster testing at that power level, a suitable iodine compatible vacuum chamber including a thrust balance and diagnostics will be developed at Aerospazio. This facility will enable full characterisation and 500 h endurance testing of the developed thruster subsystem. To maximise the impact of the project, EASN will coordinate the public presence and communication, dissemination and exploitation activities.

integrated nano-photonic OMICs bio-SENSor for lung cancer	"OMICSENS aims to develop a radically new omics measurement platform that would be initially applied to improve non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) prognosis by ensuring a timely and accurate detection of Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (TKI) resistance associated to Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) mutations. Subsequently, OMICSENS will be used to improve prognosis of patients suffering from other types of cancers. 
OMICSENS targets the creation of the first nano-photonic integrated omics bio-sensor to tackle TKI resistance and improve NSCLC treatment outcome and patient prognosis. Thanks to OMICSENS, we will build a six layers technology comprised of an on-chip embedded infra-red source arrays, an artificial intelligence optimized nano-structured surface for photonic signal enhancement, a functionalized surface of high absorbance to specific analytes, a microfluidics system to deliver the sample, a metamaterial-based photo detector array with optimized quantum efficiency and an AI algorithm enabling analyte quantification. Our miniaturized omics bio-sensor will enable real time and concurrent measurements of omics, compatible with organ-on-chip (OOC) in the future. OOC is one of the most promising bioengineering developments, paving the way to more efficient drug testing and personalized medicine trough digital twinning of a biological system. But OOC is lacking a real-time, integrated bio-sensing technology. OMICSENS proposes a disruptive bio-sensor to bridge this gap. OMICSENS will create a radically new device useful for telehealth, capable of improving medical diagnostics, while fostering a patient-centered approach. To achieve our novel and ambitious objective, we have brought together an interdisciplinary consortium of top-level academics (LMU, UNITN, IBEC, KTH) and SMEs (MW, QAI, 4K-MEMS), including expertise in oncology, bio-engineering, micro-fluidics, biochemistry, MEMS, nano-photonics, computational physics and artificial intelligence."

group-IV LASer and deTectors on Si-TEchnology Platform	"Photonics plays a key role in many applications, such as a detection of environmental or toxic gases, analyses of food or health-related products. Those applications depend on the development of highly advanced photonic components working in the mid-infrared (MIR) wavelength range. These components have always been difficult and expensive to make, as they are not compatible with standard microelectronic or photonic fabrication processes.
LASTSTEP ambitions to address this issue by developing the world-first all-Group-IV photonic platform using silicon-germanium-tin alloys (SiGeSn). Focusing on the MIR 2-5 µm region essential for sensing of chemical species, the project aims to ensure a wide scale adoption of the developed technology by offering a fully monolithic solution compatible with standard state-of-the-art 200mm CMOS manufacturing processes. The approach will enable cost-effective solutions for sensing, but also for autonomous navigation or consumer products.
To achieve this objective, LASTSTEP gathers a world class consortium composed of 3 academic partners, 2 RTOs and 3 industrials. The partners are: 
-leaders of a CMOS compatible technology for growth and processing of GeSn direct bandgap alloys in an industry-relevant environment
- two SMEs well-established on the markets of gas and liquid sensing 
- world leading PIC design and test-house company to ensure further exploitation of results.
LASTSTEP will develop four prototypes based on the fully-group-IV photonic platform for two use-cases. Prototypes will first be assembled from discrete components, then integrated on PICs.
LASTSTEP aims to secure for Europe an outstanding position in development and economic exploitation of Si photonics, thereby anticipating maximal return on investment for the EU society. LASTSTEP will bring the decisive further development of Si photonics into a technologically mature MIR platform ready for innovations in the communications, sensing, health, food and safety sector."

enhanced manufacturing of broadly potent equine polyclonal Fab with a Rational Immunization strategy against Coronaviruses	e-FabRIC will develop a new hyperimmunization strategy for generating high titers equine immunoglobulins having a broad neutralizing specificity against viral targets belonging to same subfamily phylogenic tree. The viral subfamily selected to demonstrate the unique benefits of this innovative way to induce highly anti-viral active antibodies is the sarbecovirus subfamily. The equine antibodies will be processed as purified F(ab’)2 fragments, a well-known pharmaceutical product with a strong historical safety record in human patients. The F(ab’)2 antibody fragments generated by e-FabRIC are expected to display a unique and very wide neutralizing activity spectrum. This new property will be the synergistic outcome of the immunization with a nanoparticle co-displaying 8 different sarbecovirus RBD subunits (designated as “mosaic antigen”) and the natural immunogenetic diversity present in individual horses. In each individual horse, the mosaic antigen immunization will drive the generation and maturation of antibodies highly focused on conserved epitope structures shared by the different sarbecovirus RBD subunits and associated with viral neutralization. As each horse's own immunogenetics will mature the mosaic antigen-specific antibodies in a different way, several equine individual antibody specificities will be pooled in order to expand the overall broad viral neutralizing activity of the final pharmaceutical product. The combined multiplicity of individual antibody response diversities and the highly focused antibody responses induced by the mosaic antigen will be the basis of a broadly potent, immunotherapy pharmaceutical F(ab’)2-based product able to significantly reduce the clinical and societal impact of any emergence of a new human sarbecovirus outbreak. The scientific and technical learnings of this new and powerful immunization strategy will be applicable to other viral families from which human infectious threats may arise.

an electric Contrast medium for computationally intensive Electroencephalographies for high REsolution BRain imaging withOut skull trepanation	Imaging the brain activity is fundamentally important for many brain-related scientific disciplines. Among the non-invasive neuroimaging strategies, Electroencephalography (EEG) from scalp potentials is one of the primary. In EEG the neuroninduced electric potential is measured by using electrodes on the patient’s scalp. The skull however, highly resistive, shields EEG recordings limiting the spatial resolution. The standard way to avoid skull shielding effects is to invasively implant EEG electrodes under the skull (ECoG) or in the brain cortex (StereoEEG), in both cases after trepanning the patient’s skull. Scalp EEGs are noninvasive but lack spatial imaging accuracy. ECoG and StereoEEG are highly accurate but require skull trepanation and they image only a limited part of the brain. There is the need for increasing the resolution of scalp EEG providing the same level of accuracy of invasive EEGs. This will be the grand challenge which CEREBRO will achieve by conceiving the first ever existing EEG contrast medium, able to provide imaging of the entire brain and in a non-invasive way.

ZERo-carbon building enabling Adaptive opaque Facade technology	Building market demands high indoor environmental quality but is under the pressure of energy price volatility, European policies, targeting a carbon neutral building stock by 2050, and local building regulations. A drastic carbon footprint reduction on the EU building stock is only possible with: (i) a strong reduction of heating and cooling energy demand and (ii) the limitation of the embodied environmental impacts of building materials. We propose a disruptive facade concept, the ZERo-carbon building enabler Adaptive opaque Facade (ZERAF), to get a huge decrease in the operational energy demand, while reducing the environmental impact of new and existing buildings through novel materials. ZERAF concept enables shifting the opaque building façade systems from being static thermal barriers to thermal modulators. The disruptive configurations of opaque façade technology and the use of novel materials (smart Shape Memory Alloys, and new generation bio-based polyurethanes) enable such a dynamic thermal control. Moreover, ZERAF minimizes the number of primary sources (in terms of volume and diversity) and then of the embodied carbon. ZERAF radically reconceptualizes the adaptive opaque facades concept, taking the opportunity of doing high-risk/low-TRL research in an interdisciplinary environment to bring cutting edge novelties from aerospace, biomedicine, nanomaterials, chemistry and IOT to building sector. The objective is to scientifically prove that ZERAF concept can control all heat transfer mechanisms in opaque building façades to a significant level. Prototypes will be manufactured for the first time and their thermal behaviour will be characterized in a dedicated laboratory coupling a calorimeter and a continuous sun simulator. To prove that used materials, fabrication processes and assembly methods do not jeopardize the carbon footprint reduction, most relevant sustainability parameters will be quantified through a building life cycle method.	energy saving; opaque facades as thermal modulators; smart materials; adaptive insulation; bio-based polyurethanes; control algorithms; carbon neutrality; buildings;	ACCADEMIA EUROPEA DI BOLZANO - Eurac Research	ACTIVE INSULATION SYSTEMS B.V. -; INDRESMAT SL - INDRESMAT	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101098490/program/43108390/details	
Youth co-Production for sustainable Engagement and Empowerment in health	"Most traditional youth mental health interventions fail to achieve sustainable impact at scale because they overly rely on individualized, medical illness-focused models and treat youth as passive beneficiaries. citiesRISE, a multi-stakeholder initiative founded in 2017 to address these gaps, has worked with youth, communities, and professionals across five cities, as well as social innovators in over twenty countries, to develop a set of evidence-based, scalable youth mental health interventions and implementation models. The YiPEE project aims to provide robust evidence on the feasibility, adaptability, effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness of a multi-component intervention targeting the inner, social, and environmental dimensions that underpin mental health and broader NCD risk reduction outcomes, when implemented using a youth-informed and -activated approach. This will be achieved through a a mixed-methods approach, conducting a realist evaluation across the four sites (Chennai, India; Nairobi, Kenya; Cape Town, South Africa; Stockholm, Sweden) to study key implementation outcomes following the Practical Robust Implementation and Sustainability Model (PRISM) as well as the mechanisms underlying why the intervention works, for whom, and under what real-world conditions. In Chennai, YiPEE will conduct a randomized controlled trial for more robust evaluation of effectiveness and cost-effectiveness in achieving key mental health and other NCD related lifestyle behavioral outcomes.
YiPEE focuses on the combination of a school-based multicomponent intervention targeting positive disruption in the inner, social, and environmental dimensions of adolescents’ mental health and a youth-informed and -activated implementation model that puts young people at the centre of transformation, working collaboratively with a range of other stakeholders.

Wholistic and Integrated digitaL tools for extended Lifetime and profitability of Offshore Wind farms	"Wind energy takes on a large share in the energy market and will play a crucial role in securing the stability of power grids in the future. However, operation of wind farms, and especially offshore wind farms, are not yet ideal. The operation in fluctuating conditions of wind availability and power grids demand as well as the harsh environmental condition where the offshore wind farms are built, have a negative effect on the structure health of the wind turbines, and therefore on their useful lifetime. 
In this context, WILLOW will develop an integrated system that will provide an open-source, data-driven smart curtailment solution to the Wind Farm Operators with the basis of an integrated Wind Farm Control system looking for a trade-off between the power production and the lifetime consumption. With this aim, WILLOW pretends to design a novel Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) System able to provide high quality data to perform a reliable fleet life assessment using physical models and data-based AI methods which will be used for decision-making and maintenance scheduling. This will contribute to the reduction of the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) and to the increase of the Annual Energy Production (AEP) towards the current trend of design and operating life of offshore wind farms with up to 20 MW turbines beyond 50 years.
The WILLOW consortium consists of 12 partners with complementary assets and founded expertise, capable to take on the challenge set out by the topic.

Wellbeing, inclusion, sustainability and the economy	"WISE Horizons will inform and accelerate the transition to a new economic paradigm with wellbeing, inclusion and sustainability at its core. The project will create a state-of-the-art theoretical framework which synthesises the current post-growth initiatives through a novel and open access WISE accounting framework. The framework will define core terms and link to Beyond-GDP metrics, satellite accounts, policy strategies and the current generation of economic and integrated models. It will link to European policy strategies such as the Net-zero targets, the Circular Economy transition and Sustainable Competitiveness. With partners in Africa, the US and China it will also globally assess the current and new economic paradigms from the perspective of Sustainable Developments Goals.

Any transition will result in trade-offs and synergies between different elements of a new economy such as wellbeing, inclusion and sustainability. These will be empirically analysed and used to inform policy and society about the choices that will shape the future up to 2050. The historical empirical analyses will use the WISE database and thematic/integrated models that address the core questions and policies of the post-growth society will be created by leading experts/institutes in the field of Beyond-GDP, inequality, sustainability and post-growth economics.

To maximise the impact of the project, the WISE stakeholder Platform, which is a “network of networks” will be created and the groups involved in the WISE Platform will be engaged in communication, dissemination and exploitation. The empirical research involved in this project will be done in a novel co-creative approach involving stakeholders in 5 co-creation labs/workshops. Special attention is given to individuals that are negatively affected by the transformation. An ambitious communication strategy will facilitate a new public debate away from the standard economic paradigm and towards a new paradigm fit for the future."

Versatile printed solutions for a safe and high-performance battery system	"In order to boost the transition to a climate neutral transport sector, VERSAPRINT will bring innovations to the battery system to tackle safety issues, enhance performances as well as decrease cost and environmental impact. The VERSAPRINT technical solutions will be achieved mainly by 2D/3D printing directly on battery components and will operate from the heart of the battery system (i) providing an efficient cell thermal regulation in order to reduce risk of Thermal Runaway (TR) and increase density and lifetime; (ii) significantly improving the system thermal and safety management thanks to in operando sensoring; (iii) adding thermal and safety-oriented functionalities on busbars; (iv) allowing easy and safe dismantling and re-manufacturing; (v) lowering the casing’s weight, without losing its capability to contain TR and while ensuring good recycling rate; (vi) providing an advanced thermal/fire response; and (vii) controlling the exhaust gases released during a TR by cooling and evacuating them safely.
VERSAPRINT will also implement a Decision Tool in order to choose the most optimised configuration for a given end application and will provide a validation at TRL5 (i) at module level with two module prototypes (for automotive and aeronautics) as well as one virtual module prototype (for waterway transport); (ii) at system level through simulation for all these applications. Other applications such as bus, non-road mobile machinery and stationary storage will be explored as well, through simulation.
VERSAPRINT aims to reach the cost and performances targeted in Batteries Europe 2030 KPIs, while increasing module density by 5% and significantly improving the battery system fire resistance and safety (no fire outside module during TR). Sustainability will be assessed at all development stages.

Vehicles and VRU Virtual eValuation of Road Safety	"In order to set policies for road safety in the coming decades and push for Vision Zero, an accepted and reliable method for the comparison of safety measures for CCAM is needed. The proposed method will deal with the safety of all road users, from vulnerable road users to vehicle occupants.  

V4Safety will provide a prospective safety assessment framework that can handle a large variety of safety measures, ranging from in-vehicle safety technology, new vehicle types, infrastructure solutions to regulations that influence road user behaviour. It includes methods to project the results in future scenarios and over EU regions for use by policy makers, authorities and consumer organizations.

V4Safety strives for comparability of results of safety studies by not only providing the framework but also guidelines for using it. The guidelines show how to select, configure and connect relevant human, vehicle and environment models; how to select a baseline approach and how to project to a conclusion to different regions of interest in the EU. Moreover, the framework will also allow projections for future scenarios, incorporating possible changes in the mobility system.

To understand differences between studies and to understand the influence of underlying data, assumptions and models, the method provides tools to characterise the influence of the determinants.

Combined with a well-defined baseline approach – what to compare to? - the resulting transparency and consistency in simulation-based safety assessment leads to much improved comparability and reliability of assessment conclusions."	safety; prospective; assessment; framework; measures; policy; authorities; type approval	NEDERLANDSE ORGANISATIE VOOR TOEGEPAST NATUURWETENSCHAPPELIJK ONDERZOEK TNO - NETHERLANDS ORGANISATION FORAPPLIED SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH	BAYERISCHE MOTOREN WERKE AKTIENGESELLSCHAFT - BMW GROUP; BUNDESANSTALT FUER STRASSENWESEN - BAST	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101075068/program/43108390/details	
Value-Aware Artificial Intelligence	"By Value-Aware AI we mean AI that includes a component performing the same function as human moral consciousness, namely the capacity to acquire and maintain a value system, use this value system to decide whether certain actions are morally acceptable and be aware of the value systems of its users so as to understand the intent and motivation of their actions and to properly and correctly engage with them.  

The VALAWAI project will develop a toolbox to build Value-Aware AI resting on two pillars both grounded in science: An architecture for consciousness inspired by the Global Neuronal Workspace model developed on the basis of neurophysiological evidence and psychological data, and a foundational framework for moral decision-making based on psychology, social cognition and social brain science.  

The project will demonstrate the utility of Value-Aware AI in three application areas for which a moral dimension urgently needs to be included: (i) social media, where we see many negative side effects such as disinformation, polarisation, and the instigation of asocial and immoral behavior, (ii) social robots, which are designed to be helpful or influence human behavior in positive ways but potentially enable manipulation, deceit and harmful behavior, and (iii) medical protocols, where VALAWAI tries to ensure medical decision making is value aligned.  

The project contributes to the general goal of making EU-based AI more competitive by being more reliable, robust, ethically-guided, explainable and hence trustworthy. It does not make new proposals for guidelines and regulations (for which there is already considerable effort) but advances the state of the art in core AI technology so that ethics is embedded inside applications making them grounded in universal, European and personal values."	awareness technology; values; moral judgment; norms; information integration; computational reflection; meta-level representation; moral agency; moral cognition; intentionality attribution	AGENCIA ESTATAL CONSEJO SUPERIOR DE INVESTIGACIONES CIENTIFICAS - CSIC	FONDAZIONE ISTITUTO ITALIANO DI TECNOLOGIA - IIT; FUNDACIO INSTITUT HOSPITAL DEL MAR D INVESTIGACIONS MEDIQUES -	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101070930/program/43108390/details	
Valorisation of iron-rich & Zinc-containing steelmaking by-products via HYdrogen-based ReductiON	"In the coming years, innovative DR shafts and EAFs will be installed in several steelmaking sites across Europe to follow the strategic decarbonization guidelines. The progression of these production processes will imply changes in the composition and management of generated by-products, especially for those containing Zn. Likewise, the large rate of fossil fuels/reductants needed in the current valorisation processes of these wastes make them very intensive in terms of CO2 emissions, requiring the metallurgical industry to move to H2 applications in its targeted pathway towards zero wastes goal. To tackle with these complex challenges and to solve the recycling of key steelmaking by-products like EAF dust, BOF dust and sludges, DR sludge and pellet fines and mill scales (among others), ZHYRON will develop an innovative valorisation route for Fe-rich and Zn-containing by-products based on the combination of pyrometallurgical (using green H2 as reductant) and hydrometallurgical stages The iron oxides units would be recovered as Direct Reduced Iron able to be consumed in EAF and the zinc would be recovered as zinc oxide concentrate to be used in zinc smelting sector, contributing thus to circular economy and industrial symbiosis approaches.
The proposed technologies will be developed and endorsed at lab pilot scale (TRL6), and the obtained circular products will be validated by testing and characterization analysis. ZHYRON will also examine solutions regarding technical integration, economic and environmental criteria, contributing to the development of novel business models, guidelines and strategies. ZHYRON has been structured in 6 WP, combining R&D activities, project management and dissemination activities, and gathering a competitive consortium of 9 partners from 6 EU countries. If the solutions are successful, the benefits will include avoiding landfill of dangerous wastes, reduction in the CO2 emissions and the implementation of a new circular economy loop."

V A L I D A T E - Validation of a Trustworthy AI-based Clinical Decision Support System for Improving Patient Outcome in Acute Stroke Treatment	Based on previously developed models and an existing prototype of a clinical decision support system (patent pending), we set out in this project to further develop, test, and validate this clinical decision support for the treatment stratification of acute stroke patients to improve patient outcome.  Machine learning (ML)-enabled Artificial intelligence (AI) methods are increasingly adopted in the medical field. Implementing ML-based CDSSs have the potential to be go beyond the current clinical state-of-the-art as AI excels at finding complex and non-linear relationships across a multitude of prognostic variables. AI also has the promise to combine different modalities, such as imaging and clinical values, leading to powerful stratification tools accounting for a multitude of patient sub-populations.  Our consortium combines excellence in technical and medical machine learning development with the clinical expertise of three leading stroke hospital partners. Additionally, our consortium benefits from the special expertise in the development of trustworthy AI, software design, and the translation of AI models to the clinical setting with focus on the regulatory process. By leveraging the available medical data and exploiting technological opportunities in the field of AI, and developing and validating trustworthy AI solutions to be implemented in the clinical workflow we are seeking to surpass the clinical state-of-the-art by making a significant and sustainable impact on the treatment of acute stroke that will improve patient survival, outcome and quality of life.

Up-Skilling for Industry 5.0 Roll-Out	"The 4th Industrial Revolution/Industry 4.0 has enabled reduction of production costs, improved consistency of product quality and enabled mass customisation by merging the physical and digital worlds. The transition is still ongoing - Industry 4.0 is a general-purpose technology, adding value across all industrial sectors. However, the perception of Industry 4.0 at a human level has not all been positive. It has been plagued by fear of job cuts and in some sectors completely replacing the human workforce. Automation projects have often failed due to omitting the critical skilled human elements in business success with unintended consequences including reduced customer satisfaction, poorer product quality and lower process efficiency. Automation alone clearly cannot be a source of sustained competitive advantage. I5.0 will address the balance between humans and technology, focussing on the collaborative relationship between skilled workers and automation. The intent is reinstate skilled craftsmanship at the centre of production processes where people add unique value and competitive advantage, augmented by intelligent, data-driven technology emerging from Industry 4.0.

In the Up-Skill project, we will address the implications of Industry 5.0, in particular the relationship between automation, skilled work and organisational systems. Our research will establish how the relationship between automation and human input plays out in a range of industrial settings, creating comparative case studies to capture effective implementation strategies. We will address under-explored strategic spaces in production - where automation adds value to skilled and artisanal work, and where further automation risks undermining product value. This research will identify the shifting organisational characteristics that are needed to ensure technology advancements are implemented within companies while ensuring sustainable, added value for man, machine, and organisation."

Unveiling the complexity of radio foregrounds for the detectability of the CMB polarization B-mode	"One of the main challenges in Cosmology is the detection of the primordial B-mode of CMB polarization, which would constitute a confirmation of the inflationary period of the Universe. However, the presence of different contaminants, mainly coming from the emissions of our own Galaxy, constitutes one of the major limiting factors to constrain reliably the existence of the B-modes. Indeed, the success of future CMB polarization experiments lies in the improved understanding and removal capability of foreground emissions.
RadioForegrounds+ will provide a state-of-the art description of the highly complex properties of the polarised radio emission from our Galaxy, in particular the synchrotron and the anomalous microwave emissions, as well as of the population of radio sources. It will also provide an unprecedentedly thorough description of the intensity signal. This goal can only be achieved by combining the ESA’s Planck satellite maps (30-857GHz) with the unique low frequency experiments considered in this proposal: QUIJOTE (10-40 GHz), C-BASS (5 GHz) and S-PASS (2.3 GHz), by counting within the consortium with experts on the previous data sets (including the teams responsible for QUIJOTE and C-BASS) and by using the most advanced analysis techniques.
The combination of these datasets will provide high-level data products, that will range from more complete radio catalogues, including fainter sources and additional frequency coverage, to new component separated maps in wider regions of the sky. These new data products and models will be made available to the scientific community through widely-used platforms, increasing the scientific return and the impact of the project. We will also provide forecasts of the impact of radio foregrounds on the detectability of the B-mode of polarization for future CMB experiments. The resulting analyses will play a key role in preparing and supporting future international CMB missions as LiteBIRD or ground-based efforts as CMB-S4."

Unveiling Innovation Potential of Circular Approaches in Automotive Electronics and Beyond	"To strengthen EU’s global competitiveness and resilience, the updated Industrial Strategy calls for accelerating the green and digital transitions of key European ecosystems. UNICORN foresees functional electronics as an enabler & catalyser of EU mobility’s twin transition. Using a car-as-a lab, UNICORN is aiming at increasing the circularity-driven functional integration of electronics in automotive, while simultaneously embedding eco-design principles in their development and ensuring net beneficial effect on climate change mitigation.
UNICORN will demonstrate a capability to design & develop innovative green and circular technologies for automotive electronics, based on four electronic systems (composite-embedded, in-molded, textile/plastic and rubber-integrated) taken from industrial use cases for a battery casing, a dashboard, a seat/door system and a tire. Solutions will 1) encompass lightweight, low impact and/or bio-based materials for (flexible) substrates, films, encapsulation, inks, solvents, adhesives and flat cabling & interconnects; 2) validate resource/energy efficient, net shape, additive, printing, encapsulating and (reversible) bonding manufacturing processes for circuitry, sensors, gauges, antennas, interconnects; and 3) implement design for material circularity via reversible design, modularity, form factors to increase disassembly and recovery of valuable material.
For harnessing benefits of these technologies, UNICORN will set a new methodology for net impact assessment and eco-design guidelines for automotive electronics designers & developers. It will establish a vision and roadmap on the role of functional electronics for supporting EU mobility climate targets, and set the blueprints for transfers in further application sectors.

Unprecedented photolithographic structuring of novel light-sensitive poly(amino acid) materials– a paradigm shift in delivering biocompatible devices	"Photolitography, which produces geometrical structures through light-induced polymerisation of monomers with high accuracy, precision and spatial resolution, was a key innovation enabler in the drive for high-performance miniature electronics, which had an unprecedented impact on every aspect of our modern life. Geometrically well-defined microstructures could also be a game changer in the medical device industry, especially in the development of implantable devices with better tissue compatibility, as well as in the discovery of new drugs and treatments. 
Current gold standard materials and biomaterial extrusion processing cannot generate the structural resolution to kick-start this new era. The groundbreaking approach of POLINA is to combine a radically new, light-sensitive poly(amino acid) material platform with established and emerging photolithographic patterning techniques to deliver a revolutionary technology that can be exploited for medical devices and next-generation green electronics. Exploring this uncharted territory will be possible through an ambitious multidisciplinary approach delivering breakthroughs in photopolymerisation of amino acids and their lithographic structuring for novel materials with unique biological properties. 
The high innovation potential of this technology to overcome current limitations will be demonstrated in three selected examples related to lung diseases, i.e., micropatterned cell surface models, spheroid arrays for lung disease modelling and drug testing as well as tracheal implants. Our intersectoral team of 5 academic groups and 2 SMEs brings together unique scientific expertise in photo and polymer chemistry, biomaterials science, lithographic processing, tissue engineering, clinical expertise and innovation management. Through POLINA we will pave the way to revolutionise bioprinting, for safer, smarter and affordable medical devices and in the long term a new approach in (bio)electronics."	amino acids; poly(amino acid)s; photolithography; nano-structures; 2D/3D structures; medical devices	ROYAL COLLEGE OF SURGEONS IN IRELAND -	4DCELL -; CENTRE NATIONAL DE LA RECHERCHE SCIENTIFIQUE CNRS - CNRS; RUPRECHT-KARLS-UNIVERSITAET HEIDELBERG - UHEI	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101129842/program/43108390/details	
Unobtrusive Continuous Multi-Metabolite Monitoring for a Physiological Care of Insulin-treated Diabetes	"It will be a radically new approach for long-term continuous monitoring of insulin-treated persons with diabetes (ITD) moving from a glucose-only to a multi-metabolite monitoring - glucose, lactate and 3 ß OH-butyrate– paradigm. Multi-metabolite monitoring will also lead to a diabetes therapy breakthrough by algorithmically driving a continuous physiologic insulin delivery by a maintenance-free implanted MEMS pump using the peritoneal route enabling an optimal therapy for subjects with ITD.
Our vision is a fully implantable artificial organ to replace insulin secretion loss by targeting metabolic health instead of mere glucose control and mimicking physiological insulin action. While offering a really burden-free life for insulin-treated children and adults, it is expected to allow a dramatic reduction of metabolic variations, hence a minimization of acute and long-term complications and an abating of the still high mortality of T1D patients.
Unobtrusive living with diabetes will be reached by the calibration-free, implantable, long-term multi-metabolite monitoring solution connected wirelessly to a novel highly miniaturized silicon MEMS micropump, with down to 50 nl stroke volume, able to operate a newly developed U1000 insulin and enabling reservoir refill cycles of 180 days up to 365 days.  Both devices hold durable battery operating life of more than 8 years without recharge and are suitable for children. Newly designed control algorithms based upon multiple signal inputs will drive automated insulin delivery without the need of obtrusive meal and physical exercise announcements."

UNIVERSAL SENSOR BASED ON ELECTRICALLY-PUMPED MID-INFRARED SPECTROMETER ON SILICON CHIPS	"High resolution optical spectroscopy in the mid-infrared (mid-IR) spectral range (3-12 µm wavelength) is an unambiguous way to detect and quantify small traces of greenhouse and toxic gases down to sensitivities of parts-per-billion. Such sensitivities are a prerequisite to safeguard low-pollution and toxic-free environment defined by the EU Action Plan: ""Towards a Zero Pollution for Air, Water and Soil.” However, size, cost, and general complexity of the commercially available instruments limits their use to a small number of highly specialized applications, and prevents their deployment with sufficient coverage e.g. in networks, wearable electronics, etc. Particularly in the context of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, on chip integration of spectroscopic systems would constitute a game changer for mid-IR high-precision and portable sensors.
The objective of UNISON is to address this challenge and demonstrate a highly scalable platform for infra-red spectroscopy that has both high-end performance and is compact. UNISON sensing scheme relies on dual comb spectrometers obtained by leveraging on electrically pumped cascade lasers (QCL and ICL) and on silicon-germanium (SiGe) mid-IR photonic circuits to surpass current spectroscopic systems in terms of detection bandwidth, point spacing and system compactness. UNISON is organized around 3 main cornerstones each of them relying on ambitious physical and technological challenges: (i) tunable large bandwidth frequency combs will be generated on SiGe photonics circuits  by combining electro-optical comb generation, non-linear effects and dispersion engineering ; (ii) the comb sources will be pumped by novel electrically-driven cascade laser sources integrated with the SiGe photonics circuits ; (iii) compact, broadband, and sensitive interaction region for trace gas detection, designed and optimized for the SiGe platform, will be integrated with the dual comb source to showcase the sensing capability of the spectrometer."

UNDERSTANDING PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS OF LIVE ATTENUATED VACCINES FOR THE PREVENTION AND CONTROL OF AFRICAN SWINE FEVER IN WILD BOAR AND DOMESTIC PIGS	"African swine fever (ASF) has recently transformed from an exotic disease to a panzootic threat to domestic and wild suids world-wide. Europe is currently facing different scenarios with front and point introductions, affected wild boar and domestic pig populations, epidemic and endemic situations. While our traditional prevention and control strategies work well with industrial pig farms, we quickly reach our limits when we have to control the disease in the abundant wild boar population or in regions with a majority of backyard farms. To turn the tide and to safeguard animal health, vaccines, especially oral vaccines for wild boar, could be the missing tool.
There has been considerable progress in vaccine development and while we should continue to look for alternative approaches, we must now also dare to test the promising candidates beyond simple proof-of-concept studies. Only in this way can we generate the data base for benefit-risk analysis of whether and how current generation vaccines could be employed.
Along these lines, this project sets out to test the vaccine candidate ""ASFV-G-ΔI177L"" in safety and efficacy tests after oral and intramuscular application as prescribed by international guidelines. This vaccine candidate has shown safety and very good protection under laboratory conditions and has been applied in the field in Vietnam. As a backup option, other promising candidates, “ASFV-G-ΔMGF” and “ASFV-G-Δ9GL/UK, will be tested in initial comparative trials. Accompanying the prescribed tests, our interdisciplinary consortium will characterize the protective immune responses, target the optimization of oral immunization and model tailored vaccination strategies. The data body generated in this project is crucial for benefit-risk-assessments at the level of all authorities entrusted with licensure and deployment of ASF vaccines and for this reason, relevant stakeholders will be involved from the start to guarantee full exploitation of our data."

ULTRA-LIGHT, SELF-CORRECTING, “LIVE” MIRRORS: Lowering the areal density of mirrors and maximizing performance with non-abrasive, additive, 3D-printed novel technology.	We propose to develop ultralight, self-correcting mirrors for use in the next generation of large optical telescopes and solar energy concentrators.  Presently, the best mirrors have a density of about one-half a metric-ton per square-meter or more in order to provide the stiffness which is necessary to keep the optical shape under the variable conditions given by the changing gravity vector as the telescopes track a position on the sky, as well as to withstand variable wind conditions.  We intend to replace such a massive mirror with a “sandwich” of very light, optically perfect, “fire-glass” (window pane) coated sheets stiffened with layers of Electro-active polymers that can be deposited through additive manufacturing 3D printers. The sheets of glass will be heated to ~800o C in a pressurized, tailored made kiln and allowed to relax (their backside) onto a suitable mould, cast to a predetermined off-axis aspheric (parabolic) shape, while keeping the temperature below the de-vitrification temperature of the glass thus preserving the excellent optical surface quality of fire-glass window pane. Using the addressable energy of the Electro-active polymers will provide not only dynamically self-controlled stiffness but also variable push-pull action real-time multi-sensing controlled and calibrated in order to keep the optical surface to a “live-perfect” shape under general operating conditions.  These “Live-Mirrors” shall provide optical surfaces of as high a quality as those of the current best telescopes but with larger dynamic range and a reduction in weight and cost of more than one order of magnitude. Such mirrors will allow the development of 50-100 meter-class telescopes as well as of the next generation of space telescopes.  On the ground, they will also offer very low cost options for the next generation of solar energy concentrators and for antennas used for optical communications.	additive manufacturing; Electro-active polymers force-actuator; hybrid meta-material; large lightweight optical mirror; multi-sensing control; glass slumping; aspheric shape determination	CENTRE NATIONAL DE LA RECHERCHE SCIENTIFIQUE CNRS - CNRS	FUNDACION AITIIP - AITIIP; INSTITUT NATIONAL DES SCIENCES APPLIQUEES DE LYON - INSA LYON	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101099220/program/43108390/details	
Truly Resilient Quantum Limited Traveling Wave Parametric Amplifiers	TruePA will develop the next generation of Traveling Wave Parametric Amplifiers (TWPAs), which are key tools for quantum technologies and basic sciences involving the detection of weak electromagnetic signals in the microwave domain. TruePA aims at pushing TWPA devices beyond current limits pursuing three main ground-breaking advances: demonstration of TWPAs which are (i) resilient to magnetic fields, (ii) quantum-noise-limited and (iii) fully nonreciprocal. Our approach integrates novel circuit designs and the use of advanced superconducting materials, combined with new characterization methods based on quantum optics techniques. The outcomes of TruePA will highly advance the field of quantum-limited amplifiers providing novel insights into decoherence mechanisms in superconducting circuits and boosting microwave amplification performance in basic science research fields such as quantum information with solid state platforms, astronomy and dark matter search. TruePA brings together internationally known researchers with complementary expertise in the field of superconducting circuits, quantum amplifiers, nanofabrication and quantum optics. This specialized knowledge is complemented by the expertise of two industry partners, to push a new generation of TWPAs to off-the-shelf components contributing to the growth of quantum technologies in Europe and at the same time pushing forward basic science research.

Transforming brain surgery by advancing functional-guided neuronavigational imaging	In recent years, through the advancement of imaging technologies (such as MRI, PET, CT, among others) clinical localisation of lesions of the central nervous system (CNS) pre-surgery has made possible for neurosurgeons to plan and navigate away from functional brain locations when removing tumours. However, neuronavigation in the surgical management of brain tumours remains a significant challenge, due to the inability to maintain accurate spatial information of lesioned and non-lesioned locations intraoperatively. To answer this challenge, we have put together a team of engineers, physicists, data scientists and neurosurgeons to develop an innovative, all-optical intraoperative imaging system based on (i) hyperspectral imaging (HSI) for rapid, multi wavelength spectral acquisition, and (ii) artificial intelligence (AI) for image reconstruction and molecular fingerprint recognition. Our intraoperative HSI system (HyperProbe) will (1) map, monitor and quantify biomolecules of interest; (2) be handheld and user-friendly; (3) apply AI-based methods for the reconstruction of spectral images, the analysis of spatio-spectral data and the development and quantification of novel biomarkers. We will validate the developed capacity in phantoms, in vivo against gold standard modalities in neuronavigational imaging, and finally provide proof-of principle during brain tumour surgery. HyperProbe aims at providing functional and structural information on biomarkers of interest that is currently missing during neuro-oncological interventions.

Transformative Change in Telecoupled Agrofood Systems for Biodiversity and Equity	Demand for agricultural commodities from EU agrofood systems are driving land use change in biodiversity-rich countries in the Global South, leading to major biodiversity losses. Tackling the EU’s global biodiversity footprint is a top EU policy priority. The science demonstrates the need for transformative change in economic, social, and financial models for safe and just transitions, but there is limited knowledge on how to achieve transformative change in practice, which requires navigation of biodiversity, climate and equity trade-offs and synergies. TC4BE will support transdisciplinary research on different dimensions and scales of telecoupled agrofood systems, engaging diverse stakeholders, including EU and producer-country policy-makers and Indigenous Peoples and local communities. Scenarios and modelling of EU agrofood systems transformations, will be complemented by analysis of EU governance, trade, legal, consumer, collective action and sustainable finance levers and social innovations. In three producer countries (Cameroon, Colombia, and Kenya), TC4BE will generate methods for and assess land use change drivers, at-risk biodiversity hotspots, and the effectiveness of Sustainable Landscapes Initiatives. In six landscapes TC4BE will explore relationships to nature, perceptions of socio-ecological histories and futures, rigorously evaluate SLIs, and conduct regenerative enterprise case studies using a structured landscape learning process. Transformative change pathways will be co-generated by diverse stakeholders recognizing plural values and informed by new evidence, decision-making tools and training modules. The overall process will strengthen the capacity of participating stakeholders (care-knowledge-agency) to influence biodiversity and equity outcomes. A global dialogue, facilitated by the Global Landscapes Forum will link the transdisciplinary processes between the scales, supported by additional dissemination and communication activities.

Therapies for Renal Ciliopathies	Ciliopathies are a large group of rare and severe genetic diseases caused by dysfunction of the primary cilium, a microtubule-based cell surface antenna that controls key signaling output required during development and tissue homeostasis. Cilium dysfunction leads to complex disorders with high genetic heterogeneity and overlapping phenotypes. Despite the broad clinical spectrum, chronic kidney disease (CKD) leading to end stage kidney disease (ESKD) is a common cause of morbidity across ciliopathies. Currently, the only available standard of care for CKD is based on dialysis and transplantation. Renal ciliopathies represent a main cause of ESKD during childhood and despite the identification of more than 40 causative genes, it remains difficult to predict the severity of the disease as well as the risk of appearance (if not present at diagnosis) and the rate of progression of renal failure. TheRaCil therefore aims: (1) to improve diagnosis and prognosis of at risk pediatric renal ciliopathy patients, and (2) to implement therapeutic approaches aimed at targeting shared pathological pathways, at modifying mRNA targets of  the causative or modifier genes by antisense oligonucleotides and by the repurposing of available molecules. These goals will be achieved through the federation of our unique databases of pediatric renal ciliopathies cases available across Europe, which will allow a better stratification of patients, the identification of modifier genes and markers of disease progression. Bioinformatics approaches will be used to integrate patients’ biological and genetic data as well as multi-omics and functional analyses from patients samples and preclinical models. These analyses should lead to the identification of shared targetable pathological pathways as well as of patients eligible for the identified new therapeutic approaches which will be evaluated in robust preclinical models.	ciliopathies; chronic kidney disease; antisense oligonucleotides; modifiers; personalised medicine; AI technology; preclinical models; patient centered outcomes; NPH; ARPKD; clinical trial readiness	IMAGINE INSTITUT DES MALADIES GENETIQUES NECKER ENFANTS MALADES FONDATION - INSTITUTE OF GENETIC DESEASES	ASSISTANCE PUBLIQUE HOPITAUX DE PARIS -; BERGMANN CARSTEN - Medizinische Genetik Mainz	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101080717/program/43108390/details	
The role of an Epstein-Barr virus infection in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis	Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is the most frequent neuroinflammatory disease. Despite new treatments that slow the progression of the disease, patients with MS (PwMS) frequently evolve towards major disability. The pathogenesis of MS is controversially debated, but the recent discovery that infection with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a major risk factor will radically change research avenues. The BEHIND-MS consortium ambitions to understand how EBV promotes MS development. To this end, we have established a multidisciplinary team that will for the first time draw a comprehensive map of the interactions between the virus and all arms of the immune system in the blood and brain of PwMS and how they ultimately lead to neural damage, in the context of genetic risk factors. We will also develop an in vitro model of MS that integrates the virus, the immune system and brain cells reprogrammed from the blood of the same PwMS. Thus, for the first time, we will study in the laboratory the complex molecular mechanisms that give rise to MS. Finally, we will develop an animal model of prodromal MS that would be a ‘game changer’ for our understanding of MS pathogenesis and allow testing of promising new treatments. The pivotal knowledge developed in this project will empower the entire healthcare value chain to work towards better clinical management of MS. A detailed understanding of EBV-MS interactions, combined with newly identified biomarkers, and study models will open the doors for researchers, clinicians and industry to capitalize on the mechanisms underlying EBV-MS interactions, and develop new diagnostic, preventive and therapeutic tools and guidelines. Throughout the project, an open dialogue with the main stakeholder representatives will ensure a mutual understanding of patient needs and project results. Ultimately, by contributing to improved risk analysis, stratification and treatment strategies, BEHIND-MS has the potential to reduce the burden of MS on society.

The pandemic within: tackling brain vulnerability in COVID19 at high resolution: NEUROCOV	The COVID19 pandemic has shown our health care fragility vis a vis novel pathogens, with a global disruption on societal welfare. Despite the towering success of vaccine development, lack of preparedness on integrative clinical and molecular phenotyping has emerged with clarity and highlights the need to scale translational efforts for personalized prevention and therapy. Of particular concern are the long-term consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection with high and rising prevalence of chronic manifestations referred to as Post-COVID. Among these the neurological and psychiatric complications stand out for frequency, lack of treatment and devastating impact of their effects at pandemic scale. Here, we tackle the cognitive and neurodegenerative complications of COVID-19, referred to as NeuroCOVID, as a ticking pandemic within the pandemic that requires an innovation leap across disciplines. We pursue a multi scalar approach that reaches from epidemiology and mechanistic interrogation of host/virus interplay at single cell resolution through predictive modelling all the way to validation of biomarkers and repurposed drugs. The aim is to anticipate and effectively manage personalized trajectories of NeuroCOVID vulnerability and their impact at population level. For this we leverage two leading national health registries and three clinical cohorts to characterize the phenotypic spectrum of NeuroCOVID, its risk factors and its socioeconomic burden at high definition. We pioneer innovative robotics to scale brain organoid modelling and combine it with single cell multiOMICs and AI analytics to dissect the principles of the individual host response and render experimentally actionable the authentic genetic backgrounds of differential SARS-CoV-2 sensitivity. Through a substantive engagement of patients’ collectives and health care stakeholders, upstream integration of innovative pipelines streamlines translation and operationalizes precision medicine for emerging medical needs.	immune system; nervous system; SARS-CoV2; post-COVID-19; organoids; single cell omics; personalized medicine; risk factors; prediction,epidemiology; genetics; clinical cohorts; health registries; AI	DEUTSCHES ZENTRUM FUR NEURODEGENERATIVE ERKRANKUNGEN EV - DZNE	BEN-GURION UNIVERSITY OF THE NEGEV - BGU; EURICE EUROPEAN RESEARCH AND PROJECT OFFICE GMBH -	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101057775/program/43108390/details	
The malignant Glioma immuno-oncology matchmaker: towards data-driven precision medicine using spatially resolved radio-multiomics	"Adult and paediatric malignant glioma (GBM and pHGG) remain among the most difficult-to-treat cancers with 5-year survival rates of <5% despite intensive standard-of-care therapy. The differences among patients and the heterogeneous and plastic nature of each individual tumour have resulted in all therapeutic clinical trials failing during the past 20 years. Recently, immunotherapy has been showing great promise, but only in subsets of patients. Identifying those patients cannot be done a priori as biomarkers are still largely missing, nor are we able to follow-up on therapeutic efficacy when patients get treated. The GLIOMATCH project aims at improving the clinical outcome of GBM/pHGG patients by enabling immunology-based patient stratification to empower personalised matching of appropriate immunotherapy, while improving follow-up of clinical responses to existing/novel therapeutics. This will be achieved by integrating spatially resolved, multi-layered tissue maps (using integrated single-cell multiomics), with non-invasive MRI images. This integration will fuel into a novel MRI Radio-multiomics hub, that will be made available to clinical professionals through which they can perform tumour-host based patient stratification and personalised therapy matching while interpreting longitudinal follow-up and treatment efficacy. The proposed data-driven models will be developed by analysing the largest cohort of immuno-oncology (I/O) treated GBM/pHGG patients (n>300, including pre-post treatment samples) with matched controls (n>300) and exceptionally long-term surviving GBM patients (n~140), in which various tumour-host niches will be studied in how they respond to I/O perturbations and lead to improved clinical outcome. This will be empowered by deploying an UNCAN-compatible data lake, to which incremental data collection will be used to further refine the machine learning models, while proposing novel treatment options.

Targeting cancer with mutanome based stem cell vaccine	The successful application of immune checkpoints inhibitors has modified the therapeutic strategies in several cancers but only 30% of patients will respond optimally to these therapies. One of the reasons for the failure of these therapies is the resistance of cancer stem cells (CSCs) leading to relapses long after the initial treatment. These cells are also resistant to conventional therapies via their quiescence and there are no targeted therapies available against them. The ambition of IPSIRIUS, a French biotechnology company, spinoff of INSERM and Paris Saclay University is to develop active cancer immunotherapy products based on the revolutionary induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology. IPSIRIUS developed first IPVAC, with the aim of leveraging patient’s immune system against a large panel of cancer antigens which are shared between iPSC and CSCs. With IPVAC, IPSIRIUS is developing a ground-breaking technology, having resolved all technical issues limiting cell-based therapies used for cancer. IPVAC is a safe, allogenic, off-the-shelf therapy, highly scalable using a versatile technology. This cell-based vaccination strategy showed efficacy in prophylactic and therapeutic settings against aggressive solid cancers with stemness features. The overall goal of the MUTAVAC project is i) to uncover the mechanisms of action of IPVAC, ii) to generate a highly immunogenic version of IPVAC, and iii) to design robust in vitro immunogenicity tests to predict immunogenicity of IPVAC and IPVAC-Mut in humans. With MUTAVAC project, IPSIRIUS will i) strengthen the scientific data on IPVAC to prepare its clinical development and leading to the open access publications and patents, ii) define a personalised medicine to propose efficient therapeutic cancer vaccine in patients with all HLA groups, iii) identify new targets for future cancer therapies, and iv) develop a technological platform to facilitate the development of the next-generation of cell therapies.	induced pluripotent stem cells; cancer stem cells; immunotherapy vaccine	IPSIRIUS -		https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101071140/program/43108390/details	
Targeting Epstein-Barr Virus Infection for Treatment and Prevention of Multiple Sclerosis	"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory and degenerative disease of the central nervous system (CNS). It constitutes the most common non-traumatic cause of neurological impairment among young and middle-aged people and represents a major healthcare burden. Our recent research strongly implicates infection by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) as the leading cause of MS, but detailed understanding of the mechanisms how EBV contributes to the disease, and whether targeting EBV could prevent or improve the course remain unresolved.
To meet these challenges, we have established a consortium with extensive experience in neurology and MS, genetics, virology and EBV, epidemiology, immunology, clinical trials, artificial intelligence, as well as stakeholder involvement and responsible research and innovation (RRI).
By combining this expertise, the consortium takes advantage of high-quality health registries, existing research cohorts of persons with MS, and prospective randomized clinical trials of antiviral therapies targeting the EBV infection in MS. 
The ambitious goals are to answer the questions why only a few EBV infected persons develop MS, and define the underlying mechanism of this process, as well as clarify if targeting the EBV infection can prevent MS or improve the disease course. By answering these questions, we would meet the challenges defined in the current call: Relationship between infections and non-communicable diseases. We would contribute with knowledge to reduce disease burden by providing the health care system with new knowledge to better understand the cause of MS, including host risk factors that influence the development of the disease. We would also provide a basis for new or improved tools to prevent MS or disease progression. Healthcare practitioners will gain access to knowledge to guide them on preventive measures and of those persons at risk of developing MS, with the ultimate goal of eradicating the disease."	viral-host genetics; immune response; disease modelling; disease prevention	UNIVERSITETET I BERGEN - UiB	FONDAZIONE ITALIANA SCLEROSI MULTIPLA - FISM ETS - FISM ETS; FUNDACIO CENTRE DE REGULACIO GENOMICA - CRG-CERCA	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101136991/program/43108390/details	
TUNGSTEN BIOCATALYSIS – HEAVY METAL ENZYMES FOR SUSTAINABLE INDUSTRIAL BIOCATALYSIS	Europe needs a sustainable chemical industry which will only be realized by new breakthrough technologies. Industrial biotechnology is established in chemical manufacturing, offering more efficient, more specific, safer and less energy demanding production, but is held back by the limited number of enzyme classes in industrial use. This project opens up an important new enzyme class of tungsten-containing enzymes (W-enzymes) which catalyse amazing chemical reactions involving challenging low redox potential reduction reactions, but are currently impossible to obtain economically and on scale to match industrial needs. We need to produce W-enzymes using an industrial workhorse micro-organism such as E. coli. Yet, we discovered that W-cofactor biosynthesis is the bottleneck preventing successful production of W-enzymes in E. coli. We can solve this challenge by using cutting-edge computational enzyme design approaches we recently developed, to create a completely new W-cofactor biosynthesis pathway for E. coli. The W-BioCat strains developed in this project will enable expression of new W-enzymes from genetic databases, and facilitate production of new engineered W-enzymes. The catalytic potential of these new W-enzymes will be established and implemented in new processes. Exciting new reaction scope in biocatalytic CO2 reduction to valuable chemicals and Birch reduction of aromatic compounds will be explored, alongside the already-established and broadly applicable carboxylic acid reductions. W-BioCat will be the breakthrough to make W-enzymes accessible for industry. As a proof of concept, a hydrogen-driven process to convert plant-derived oleic acid to the emollient ester oleyl oleate will be created. Oleyl oleate is used in many cosmetic products used daily by millions of people. This process will be demonstrated in multi-gram yield in scalable, industrially-relevant hydrogenation reactors, together with market research to address a pathway to commercialisation.	tungsten enzymes; cofactor biosynthesis; computational protein design; carboxylic acid reduction; fatty acids; renewable hydrogen; hydrogenase; bioinformatics	TECHNISCHE UNIVERSITEIT DELFT - TU Delft	CONSORZIO INTERUNIVERSITARIO RISONANZE MAGNETICHE DI METALLO PROTEINE - CIRMMP; EVOENZYME SL -	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101129798/program/43108390/details	
TUMOUR-HOST INTERACTIONS IN LIVER CANCER OF CHILDHOOD AND ADULTS	"Liver cancer is a major health problem with ~1 million cases diagnosed each year (~90,000 cases/year in Europe), and it is the 3rd cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in adults, and hepatoblastoma (HB) in children are considered poorly understood cancers. HCC is a difficult-to-cure cancer (curation rate ~ 30%) with poor outcome (median survival < 2 years in advanced stages), due to limited understanding of at-risk populations, resistance to therapies and lack of precision oncology. In HB, outcomes are hampered in one fourth of cases due disease progression after surgical intervention and adjuvant chemotherapy. 

THRIVE aims by to improve the outcome of both paediatric and adult liver cancer patients by understanding at-risk populations, tumour-host interactions, and by developing biomarkers for current therapies and novel, affordable treatments to overcome resistance. THRIVE brings together a strong, multidisciplinary team -13 partners, from 8 countries- with complementary expertise to leverage cutting-edge technologies (single-cell RNASeq, spatial transcriptomics, microbiota analysis, artificial intelligence, mouse models and patient-derived organoids) and sectors (i.e academia, SMEs, hospitals, patient associations) and 15 patient cohorts (~6,700 samples).

THRIVE expects to: 1) Define molecular features of cancer predisposition and at-risk populations for development of liver cancer. 2) Develop a complete human liver cancer blueprint of tumour, immune, stromal cells and intra-tumoral microbiomes. 3) Identify AI-based and molecular markers of response to treatments. 4) Implement a preclinical drug testing platform for discovery of affordable therapies with high social impact. 5) Maximize the impact in the European society by integrating SSH disciplines, delivering accessible and re-usable data and tools to support EU initiatives such as the UNCAN.eu platform, and by influencing policymakers and health professionals.

THE URBAN BURDEN OF DISEASE ESTIMATION FOR POLICY MAKING	In Europe, more than 70% of the population lives in urban areas. Cities have long been known to be society’s predominant engine of innovation and wealth creation, yet they are also a main source of pollution, disease and mortality, which is to some extent linked to suboptimal urban and transport planning practices. The proposed work aims to improve the estimation of health impacts and socio-economic costs and/or benefits of environmental stressors, advance methodological approaches and foster their acceptance as common good practice for urban areas, to help strengthen evidence-based policy making at city, national and EU level. We will focus on nearly 1000 cities and environmental stressors including air pollution, noise, temperature/heat and lack of green space but we will also include physical activity as a main determinant of health and examine the effects of gender and inequality in the impact estimations. We aim to produce a system that will provide updates every 3 years to be able to monitor progress. It will extensively involve stakeholders and conduct knowledge translation. We will use transdisciplinary and systemic approaches bringing together a team of, amongst others, experts and practitioners in urban and transport planning, environment and public health, economics, retail and business, education sector, policy analysis, knowledge translation and involve citizens and NGOs.

THE CARE WAVE AND THE FUTURE OF THE BABY BOOMERS AND THEIR CHILDREN	"The baby boomers are in the process of retiring. Most are between 60 and 65 when they retire and almost 80% self-assess their health as good. A huge number of research projects has analyzed retirement decisions and the impact of this “pension wave” on the transformation of pension systems in the ageing societies in Europe and elsewhere. There is no lack of pension finance projections and policy advice for pension reforms and their socio-economic effects, including active ageing and the role of elder citizens in transforming our economies into “silver economies”.
Much less is known about the second great transformation that will follow the pension wave. In the mid2030s, the health of the baby boomers will have deteriorated and many in these large cohorts will be in need of formal and/or informal long-term care. This “care wave” will transform two generations: the baby boomers in need of care and their children who may supply care. It will have significant implications for labour supply, especially for women, saving behaviour, and therefore for productivity, economic growth and its inclusiveness. 
The overarching objective of BB-Future is to make a concerted effort to understand the size and the implications of the care wave on economic and social outcomes, to appreciate the quality of this second ageing-related transformation and to develop policy recommendations for advance planning on the EU and MS levels."

Synergetic integration of BIOteChnology and thermochemical CaTalysis for the cAscade coNvErsion of organic waste to jet-fuel	"The reduction of GHG emissions according to the Paris Agreement is particularly challenging regarding the production of “green” liquid fuels with a high energy density for the aviation sector (drop-in biokerosene). In this context, the BIOCTANE project aims to develop and optimize an innovative process for the conversion of organic waste materials naturally characterized by a high-water content (e.g. food-waste, organic material from the food processing industry) into carbon-neutral market-ready drop-in jet-fuels.
In particular, BIOCTANE project will develop a proof of concept on the synergetic coupling of biotechnological and thermocatalytic processing routes by a disruptive and interdisciplinary strategy that will result in an efficient valorization of the organic wastes into renewable jet-fuel, maximizing the recovery of chemical energy, nutrients and carbon use. 
First, the complex organic waste will be converted into platform molecules (acetoin and 2,3-butanediol) by creating a breakthrough link between biotechnological processing of biowaste and hydrothermal gasification technology. Subsequently, a novel one-pot chemical process will be developed by the combination of different catalytic steps through which the platform molecules are converted to jet-fuel range hydrocarbons. Based on an extensive process flow modelling, the process efficiency and the techno-economic requirements for full market integration as well as the environmental impact will be assessed. Best environmental performance, including recovering nutrients for reuse will be aimed for throughout the process development.
Therefore, BIOCTANE will establish a novel pathway involving hybrid processes and multifunctional catalysts, contributing to implement sustainable, secure and competitive renewable energy technologies in Europe, boosting the use of advanced biofuels and with a direct impact on strategic areas like aviation transport"	jet-fuel; biotechnology; catalytic; hydrothermal gasification; organic waste; acetoin; 2,3-butanediol	Fundacion IMDEA Energia - IMDEA Energia	AIREG - AVIATION INITIATIVE FOR RENEWABLE ENERGY IN GERMANY EV -; INSTITUT NATIONAL DE RECHERCHE POUR L'AGRICULTURE, L'ALIMENTATION ET L'ENVIRONNEMENT - INRAE	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101084336/program/43108390/details	
Symbolic logic framework for situational awareness in mixed autonomy	"SymAware addresses the fundamental need for a new conceptual framework for awareness in multi-agent systems (MASs) that is compatible with the internal models and specifications of robotic agents and that enables safe simultaneous operation of collaborating autonomous agents and humans. The goal of SymAware is to provide a comprehensive framework for situational awareness to support sustainable autonomy via agents that actively perceive risks and collaborate with other robots and humans to improve their awareness and understanding, while fulfilling complex and dynamically changing tasks.

The SymAware framework will use compositional logic, symbolic computations, formal reasoning, and uncertainty quantification to characterise and support situational awareness of MAS in its various dimensions, sustaining awareness by learning in social contexts, quantifying risks based on limited knowledge, and formulating risk-aware negotiation of task distributions. These objectives will be achieved in SymAware through (a) logical characterisation of awareness using symbolic methods, (b) quantifying the symbolic reasoning for awareness with spatial and temporal ingredients for decision making, (c) risk awareness via quantified knowledge, (d) quantifying and communicating knowledge awareness, (e) demonstrating awareness engineering in aviation and automotive use cases, and (f) identifying requirements for ethical and trustworthy awareness in human-agent interaction.

The objectives of SymAware address the ""Awareness Inside"" Challenge of EIC by extending and formalising human-based models of situational awareness and by providing a novel conceptual situational awareness framework for MASs that encompasses logical characterisation and integrative formal reasoning of interdependent awareness dimensions including knowledge, spatiotemporal, risk and social dimensions. This will support transitioning to safe mixed operation of autonomous agents and humans."

Switching european food systems for a just, healthy and sustainable dietary transition through knowledge and innovation	"The overarching goal of the SWITCH proposal is to improve understanding of knowledge, accessibility and facilitation gaps that limit present large scale adoption of sustainable and healthy diets among European citizens and to develop and demonstrate appropriate innovative solutions and tools to facilitate a just transition towards healthy and sustainable dietary behavior at all levels of the multi-actor food system in EU.
The transition towards sustainable, safe, healthy and inclusive food systems, from farm to fork has become a key priority for EU policies, in line with the UN goals sustainable development goals (SDGs). The biggest challenge at present is represented by the limited knowledge of influence dietary choices which limits large scale adoption of healthy and sustainable diets. The SWITCH ambition is to accelerate the behavioral shift of European citizens towards more sustainable and healthy patterns, using Research and Innovation (R&I) as a driver to increase knowledge, accessibility and facilitation strategies at all level of the food systems, involving a multi-actor systemic approach and a co-creation strategy to delineate solutions fair to consumers that support virtuous behavior throughout the whole food chain. For a successful large scale adoption of healthy dietary behavior, all the actors of the food systems need to be engaged, connected and valorized.

Sustainable station-keeping systems for floating wind	"To meet EU net zero targets requires a six times increase in offshore wind deployment rate, primarily in deep seas where floating offshore wind (FOW) is needed. To achieve this growth requires FOW to be economic, sustainable and supported by a wide supply chain. 
TAILWIND is focussed on station-keeping systems of FOW, which comprise mooring lines and anchoring systems. The project will unlock identified opportunities for cost reduction, reduced environmental impact and material use, and also supply chain diversification.
TAILWIND will integrate new experimental evidence, novel technologies and innovative methodologies, across mooring lines and anchors, and will quantify the resulting benefits for the overall floating system design. All innovations will be sustainable-by-design, integrating environmental, societal and economic benefits. 
For mooring lines, new synthetic rope technologies will be mechanically and chemically tested to demonstrate their suitability for small-footprint ‘taut’ moorings, validating new response models. For anchoring, geotechnical centrifuge testing and advanced soil element testing will underpin two advances: (i) new response models for the long-term loading particular to FOW, and (ii) the validation of novel anchors types including cluster anchors that are “silently” installed from small vessels and are suited to shared moorings. 
The new technologies for mooring lines and anchors will allow smaller and lighter station-keeping systems, manufactured and installed by a wider supply chain. TAILWIND will distill the models into system optimisation tools, unlocking further floater optimisation and cost reduction. Finally, an integrated life cycle assessment will quantify the economic, social and environmental impact of TAILWIND’s technologies.

Sustainable resilient data-enabled offshore wind farm and control co-design	"Wind energy is crucial for realizing climate neutrality, energy independence, and energy security. With the increased penetration of renewables in the electricity grid, there is a strong need for control technology to determine the number of electrons to produce and their destination (e.g., grid, storage, hydrogen) for maximum value to the energy system. Whereas the technology available on the market exclusively maximizes the energy yield, the future lies with optimization for cost of valued energy (COVE), which considers energy security, storage, fluctuating electricity prices, turbine component wear, and turbine lifetime. Therefore, SUDOCO will develop open-source technology for resilient, and data-enabled offshore wind farm control and co-design. We will use key aspects and insights in wind farm operation to develop the Control Room of the Future that will allow operators to control wind farm output and loads by minimizing the COVE. SUDOCO will combine novel dynamic control algorithms, hybrid physics-based and data-driven models for the design of physical farms considering their governing control laws, which are safeguarded against adversarial threats and third-party fraud. Our data driven integrated control tool chain will be trained, validated and optimized using several high-fidelity datasets. These include data from full-scale dedicated wake steering control experiments performed at the 69 11-MW turbines in the Hollandse Kust Noord wind farm. We will also perform unprecedented wind farm control experiments with scaled wind turbine models in the largest boundary layer wind tunnel in Europe.
SUDOCO will target a COVE reduction of 10%, and includes means to minimize environmental impact as well as address the variability of the wind resource. SUDOCO will deliver the first intelligent integrated wind farm control and design solution for reliable, safe, and cost- effective operation of large bottom-fixed and floating offshore wind farms."

Sustainable COVID-19 Vaccination for Long-term Vaccine Immunity and Effectiveness	Despite the rapid development of various SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, the control of the pandemic is hampered by the constant emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants escaping vaccine-induced immunity and the waning of immunity. SOLVE will tackle these challenges by deciphering the mechanisms of induction of long-lasting immunity and evaluating new vaccine platforms. To achieve this goal, an integrated plan has been developed including six pillars: 1) Vaccine discovery and design; 2) Head-to-head evaluation of the immune response and long-lasting immunity induced by four vaccine platforms in the preclinical setting; 3) Validation of the pre-clinical results in an experimental medicine trial (EMT); 4) Immune mechanisms of long-lasting immunity; 5) Data Science; 6) Determinants of population adherence to vaccination. New immunogens including key mutations from most recent variants in RBD and Nucleocapsid sequences highly conserved across Sarbecoviruses,  will be delivered through: antigen-targeting to dendritic cells (DC), i.e., CD40 DC-targeting, nanoparticles, a MVA vector and 2nd generations of mRNAs. SOLVE will evaluate in depth the immunogenicity of these vaccines in the preclinical setting, and in an EMT testing two vaccines, i.e., CD40 DC-targeting and MVA with available GMP clinical lots. SOLVE will benefit from the most advanced technologies to identify the mechanisms of long-lasting immunity. Integrative analyses of high throughput data, including from large cohorts, will provide insights for identification of factors (demographics, vaccines, immunity) which impact quality and longevity of immunity. SOLVE will investigate stakeholders’s perspective on the acceptability of large vaccination campaigns to improve implementation of next generation of vaccines in a preparedness track. The consortium gathers 8 renowned public/private institutions supported by a governance facilitating fast sharing of information to keep up with a tight schedule imposed by the pandemic.

Sustainable Bioinspired Wax Coating for Multi-Functional Crop Protection	"According to the FAO, plant diseases cost the global economy around 210€ billion per year, and fungal pathogens destroy at least a third of all food crops annually. Commercial agriculture relies on chemical fungicides for crop protection owing to their easy application and low cost; however, their overuse and misuse have devastating implications for all living systems and the entire ecosystem. Thus, establishing sustainable crop protection strategies is essential for global economic development, environmental protection, and food security.

Inspired by superhydrophobic plants, such as lotus and broccoli which exhibit wax crystals on their cuticles, we propose a generic sustainable strategy for passive crop protection against fungal pathogens. Our biomimetic technology, termed SafeWax, relies on bio-derived non-toxic fatty acid-based sprayable formulations which self-assemble into a multifaceted protective coating with anti-adhesive, self-cleaning and antifungal properties. When applied on sensitive crops, which do not naturally exhibit wax crystals, SafeWax will synthetically render their foliage to passively resist pathogens. SafeWax concepts will initially be demonstrated on grapevine, as a relevant model crop of high importance to Europe’s economy, environment and culture, which is highly susceptible to fungal diseases and is the most-frequently treated crop. SafeWax will then be expanded to other sensitive commodity crops. The biodegradable SafeWax coating will not only protect crops from fungal infections but will also be tuned to provide UV radiation filtering, prevent sun damage, as well as facilitate water collection from dew condensation, mitigating inevitable effects of climate change.

SafeWax will revolutionize the global fungicides market (valued > 20 billion €), starting from the biofungicide market with a value of 3,2 billion € by 2025."	fungicide; pesticide; wax; fatty acids; plant protection product; bioinspired	TECHNION - ISRAEL INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY -		https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101099462/program/43108390/details	
Supervised morphogenesis in gastruloids	The lack of realistic in vitro organ models that can faithfully represent in vivo physiological processes is a major obstacle affecting the biological and medical sciences. The current gold standard is animal experiments, but it is increasingly clear that these models mostly fail to recapitulate the human physiology. Moreover, animal experiments are controversial, and it is a common goal in the scientific community to minimize the use of animals to a strictly necessary minimum. The emergence of stem cell engineered organ models called organoids represents the only viable alternative to animal research. However, current organoid technology is yet to produce the larger physiologically relevant organmodels that the medical sciences really need. Specifically, current organoids are too small, not vascularized and lack the 3-dimensional organization found in vivo. In this interdisciplinary project we aim to challenge all these limitations by using the recently developed gastruloid technology guided by cutting edge bioengineering and artificial intelligence. Gastruloids are formed by initiating the very early developmental processes and develops along a highly coordinated three axial process that closely resembles mammalian embryogenesis. Moreover, gastruloids can develop several organ precursors simultaneously and thus constitutes important improvements over conventional single-tissue organoids. To harvest the potential of gastruloid technology we will first implement large sequencing and imaging experiments to optimize the developmental trajectory of gastruloids for organ inductions. We will then build these datasets into a multimodal data matrix to identify gastruloid candidates for cardiovascular and foregut development. Specifically, we will identify candidates that show strong vasculogenesis as candidates for later vascularisation by anastomose with endothelial cells. 	gastruloids; artificial intelligence; closed loop system; organotypic modelling; microfluidic chips; multimodal imaging; raman spectroscopic imaging; microfluidics; interdisciplinary science	OSLO UNIVERSITETSSYKEHUS HF - OUS	FORSCHUNGSVERBUND BERLIN EV -; MAX-PLANCK-GESELLSCHAFT ZUR FORDERUNG DER WISSENSCHAFTEN EV - MPG	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101071203/program/43108390/details	
Superheated steam drying for sustainable and recyclable web-like materials	"SteamDry develops and pilots superheated steam drying technology (SSD) for weblike materials such as paper, board, tissue, and nonwovens. SSD is expected to reduce the consumption of energy radically, leading to 60% energy savings in a drying process, representing ~40% energy savings on the entire production line. It also demonstrates a concept that can lead to CO2 emission-free paper and board manufacturing, and an increase in the share of renewable energy. In a long term, the energy savings potential in Europe is 127 TWh or 6 B€ annually for paper and board manufacturers. In addition to pulp and paper sectors, the developed concepts are expected to be suitable for chemical industry and wood processing applications. Through the developed SteamDry concept, the technology suppliers can increase their market share revenue 230-345 M€ annually in Europe. The global annual energy savings potential is 870 TWh, almost 7x of European energy savings and market potential.

The developed solution can be installed on either existing infrastructure or on newbuilt machines with low CAPEX and OPEX creating new opportunities for technology suppliers and savings for the users of this technology. Results ultimately lead to the prosperity of these companies and the CO2-savings targets of the EU. Exploitation potential will be validated through the business cases calculated by technology suppliers and product manufacturers. 

The piloting of SSD increases knowledge of a) keeping two gas phases, air and steam, separate, b) cleaning superheated steam from biobased particles, c) operating these safely and d) AI-supported advanced control platform.

This approach builds on the consortium with strong capabilities to perform the action. The consortium consists of four R&D institutes and two universities - with piloting, technology upscaling, AI, and modeling expertise - two leading technology suppliers and five product manufacturers that are potential end users for the developed technology.

Strengthening Understanding and Strategies of business To Assess and Integrate Nature	Our global economy is intrinsically dependent on nature, and at the same time is playing a major role in its degradation. Recognition of this fact has grown substantially in the past decade, as evidenced in the EU Biodiversity strategy for 2030. However, transformative, system-wide changes are still needed to achieve the nature-positive outcomes required to 'bend the curve' of biodiversity loss. While the business case for economic actors to address biodiversity is becoming clearer in some sectors, it is still lacking in others, particularly those more removed from direct interactions with nature. SUSTAIN (Strengthening Understanding and Strategies of business To Assess and Integrate Nature) will bring together a multi-stakeholder and multi-disciplinary team to strengthen understanding and awareness of how all economic activities depend and impact on biodiversity. The project will build on existing work within the business and biodiversity space to develop and validate a database of business dependencies and impacts, develop methods that actors can use to reduce biodiversity-related risks, and a toolbox to support their application.

Strenghtening Extreme Events Detection for Flood and Drought	"“Today, one third of the world’s people, mainly in least developed countries and small island developing states, are still not covered by early warning systems... This is unacceptable, particularly with climate impacts sure to get even worse. Early warnings and action save lives. To that end, today I announce the United Nations will spearhead new action to ensure every person on Earth is protected by early warning systems within five years.”
- UN Secretary-General António Guterres on World Meteorological Day 2022/03/23

The ambition of the Strengthening Extreme Events Detection for Floods and Droughts (SEED-FD) project proposal is to give Europe, with the Copernicus Emergency Management Service, a leading position with this regard by breaking the current limitations of hydrological simulation accuracy and reliability and providing skillful floods and droughts forecasts available anywhere in the world, including in the global south for lower and middle-income countries, typically the most impacted by extreme hydrological events but also where the current knowledge gap in hydrological simulation and forecasting is highest.

Combining state-of-the-art science with crucial advances in EO and non-EO technologies, the project's global objective is to enhance the quality and portfolio of the CEMS EWS for floods and droughts and improve the reliability of predictions all over the world. SEED-FD will target every critical part of the CEMS Hydrological Forecasting Modelling chain by applying state-of-the-art science to transform new observational information into high-quality hydrometeo extreme event forecast products. It will invest in better representing hydrological processes and parameterisation techniques of the CEMS core hydrological engine (LISFLOOD) and combine the model enhancements with innovative techniques to integrate EO and non-EO data with the near real-time hydrological processing chain for reducing hydrological forecasting errors."

Stratification, Management, and Guidance of Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Patients using Hybrid Digital Twin Solutions	"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most common inherited heart disease (prevalence 1:200 - 1:500), manifested by thickening of cardiac walls, increasing risks of arrhythmia, and sudden cardiac death. HCM affects all ages - it is the leading cause of death among young athletes. Comorbidities due to gene mutations include altered vascular control, and, caused by HCM, ischemia, stroke, dementia, or psychological and social difficulties. Multiple causal mutations and  variations in cellular processes lead to highly diverse phenotypes and disease progression. However, HCM is still diagnosed as one single disease, leading to suboptimal care. 
SMASH-HCM will develop a digital-twin platform to dramatically improve HCM stratification and disease management, both for clinicians and patients. Multilevel and multiorgan dynamic biophysical and data-driven models are integrated in a three-level deep phenotyping approach designed for fast uptake into the clinical workflow. SMASH-HCM unites 8 research partners, 3 hospitals, 3 SMEs, and a global health-technology corporation in collaboration with patients to advance the state of the art in human digital-twins: including in-vitro tools, in-silico from molecular to systemic level models, structured and unstructured data analysis, explainable artificial intelligence - all integrated into a decision support solution for both healthcare professionals and patients. 
SMASH-HCM delivers new insights into HCM, improved patient care and guidance, validated preclinical tools, and above all, a first HCM stratification and management strategy, validated in a pilot clinical trial, and tested with end users. Thus providing a cost efficient and effective solution for this complex disease. SMASH-HCM develops a strategy towards fast regulatory approval.  In reaching its goals, SMASH-HCM serves as a basis for future digital-twin platforms for other cardiac diseases integrating models and data from various scales and sources."

Speckle Technology and Digital Biomarkers of Microvascular Function for Monitoring Cardiovascular Diseases	"Over 60 million people in the EU live with cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), at an annual economic cost of +210B€. Despite being largely preventable, CVDs cause more than 18.5 million deaths every year. To combat this, we develop new instruments for assessing adverse changes in microcirculatory status linked to hypertension, chronic kidney disease (CKD) and heart failure (HF), leading to earlier detection of CVDs. The instruments are developed and validated in clinical trials. We integrate two state-of-the-art technologies leading to a novel innovation, 3D speckle tissue monitoring. In addition, we demonstrate a direct use-case for unobtrusive monitoring in a smart-toilet application. 
 
Global remote patient monitoring (RPM) systems market is expected to surpass 5 B$ by 2030 with CAGR of 20%. The demand for the RPM systems is rapidly growing among the old age population. Monitoring innovations targeting this group can reduce hospitalization and costly chronic conditions. Furthermore, the technology is closely linked to wearable remote monitoring. The global wearable technology market is expected to grow to 392 B$ by 2030 with CAGR of 13.9%. The opportunity is significant as the number of wearable users currently exceeds 1 billion globally and the developed technology targets similar markets. 
 
We currently estimate that with the new instrument and digital biomarkers we can reduce the healthcare burden by over 30% by preventing CVDs. Additionally, we are aiming to identify citizens at risk of developing hypertension, CKD and/or HF and by timely intervention, we expect to reduce indirect healthcare costs by over 20%. 
 
In conclusion, our solution will integrate two existing state-of-the-art methods and provide clearly new monitoring techniques to assess the microcirculatory status, revealing early signs of CVDs. We will provide an innovative solution to emerging digital unobtrusive health markets while helping the over 60 million Europeans suffering from CVDs.

Space Application GaN transistor	"The SAGAN proposal addresses a crucial element in future satellite platforms and payloads. Spacecraft Electrical Power Systems (EPS) are a key element that enable space missions. Without an efficient EPS, many of the capabilities that we take today for granted, such as high-speed communications, GNSS and science payloads, would not be possible.
Power transistors are key elements of the electrical units that form the EPS and other systems, since they allow the most efficient (in terms of power and mass) electrical power processing topologies. During the last decade, several technological advancements have enabled a new type of transistors based on Gallium Nitride over Silicon. GaN transistors allow a reduction in mass of the equipment that uses them and a reduction in power consumption.
Currently, Europe does not have the capabilities to produce GaN transistors for space unless relying on external countries for most of the supply chain, which is something that cannot be taken for granted. The objective of the SAGAN proposal is to overcome this situation by establishing a non-dependent supply chain (design, manufacturing, processing, and qualification testing) for GaN transistors that are suitable for space applications. The transistors will be tested to assess radiation effects, thermal dynamics, structural behaviour, reliaability... 
To achieve it, a strong consortium has been established. It is composed by organisations that have the knowleadge and the facilities to fulfil the objective.  The consortium is composed of a company devoted to space level GaN transistors and integrated circuit design (SEMI ZABALA), a research foundry (IMEC), a company that processes wafers to the standards required by the technology (DISCO HI-TEC) and a satellite equipment manufacturer with component packaging capabilities (SENER). The consortium also counts with the role of GaN transistor end user, which is played by SENER as spacecraft equipment manufacturer."

Socially-acceptable Extended Reality Models and Systems	The revolutionary opportunities opened by eXtended Reality (XR) technologies will only materialize if concepts, techniques, and tools are provisioned to ensure the social acceptance of XR systems. For that, we need XR systems that are not just innovative and functionally complex, but also provide an experience that: satisfies the goals and needs of the user, is in compliance with the social context in which the system is being used, and is transparent, safe, secure, explainable and is trusted by the user. However, current generations of XR systems fail to provide the XR experience they were envisioned for since state-of-the-art models and technologies of XR systems fail to ensure full-fledged social acceptance. A truly XR experience requires a major paradigm shift in the way XR systems are designed, implemented, deployed and consumed. The SERMAS project will develop innovative, formal and systematic methodologies and technologies to model, develop, analyze, test and user-study socially-acceptable XR systems. This will be achieved by pursuing the following four main objectives:   1. Follow an inter-disciplinary, multi-sectorial, case-study-driven, scientific and technological methodology to implement the SERMAS Toolkit, a set of methods and tools that will greatly simplify the design, development, deployment, and management of socially-acceptable XR systems.    2. Apply the Toolkit to industrial case studies drawn from real-world application scenarios, thus paving the way to transferring project results to industrial practice. This will be possible through the active participation in the consortium of the developers of mass-use industrial XR applications.   3. Enable innovators to leverage the Toolkit to improve the social acceptance and cut down the time-to-market of their XR systems, thereby enhancing the competitiveness of the vendors.    4. Produce the wider SERMAS Methodology to position the use of the Toolkit and enlarge its outreach.

Smart, Aware, Integrated Wind Farm Control Interacting with Digital Twins (ICONIC)	ICONIC aims to develop innovative physical and digital tools to achieve fundamental breakthroughs for the integrated control of wind farms, considering the whole physical system at farm, turbine, and component levels, in particular the complex aerodynamic interactions among turbines. ICONIC aims to increase farm-wide power production by 15-20% under optimal wind speeds and directions for typical wind farms suffering from wake effects, with a 3%-5% increase in annual energy production (AEP) considering all working conditions over the long term. It targets an LCOE reduction of at least 6% compared with the state-of-the-art control tools deployed in the current wind industry by improving farm-wide AEP and reducing operation & maintenance costs via leveraging the latest AI and digital technologies. Extensive validations for the integrated wind farm control solutions will be conducted via high-fidelity simulation models, experiments at a national-level wind tunnel, historical operational data at BP’s and C-Power’s wind farms, a unique collection of test rigs for critical turbine components at respective companies, and real-world wind farm field tests at C-Power. ICONIC’s integrated wind farm control system will contain (1) novel AI-based wind farm control system to unlock wind farms’ full potential; (2) novel data-enhanced wind turbine controllers to fulfil farm-level commands while balancing power generation and load mitigation; (3) an integration with digital twins (DTs) as extra support to improve control and reduce costs, which contains a first-ever farm-level DT for wind farm flow systems replicating detailed physical flow fields and an innovative turbine-level DT with critical component models for loading and lifetime estimations; (4) extensions of the solutions to future 20MW turbines. ICONIC will establish new knowledge and industrial leadership in key digital, enabling and emerging technologies, and deliver next-generation tools for wind farm operation.	wind farm control; artificial intelligence; digital twin; reinforcement learning; data-driven tool	UNIVERSITEIT GENT - UGent	AALBORG UNIVERSITET - AAU; C-POWER NV -	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101122329/program/43108390/details	
Smart manufacturing for autologous cell therapies enabled by innovative biomonitoring technologies and advanced process control	"Autologous immunotherapies have revolutionised cancer treatment providing impressive survival benefits in patients with blood cancers. The next generation of personalised immunotherapies using tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) aims to overcome efficacy limitations of CAR-T therapies in the treatment of solid tumours. Lack of effective, fast, adaptive, controllable and scalable manufacturing process remains one of the critical bottlenecks for clinical adoption of such complex personalised cell therapies. 
In the SMARTER project, Achilles Therapeutics UK Limited, a clinical-stage company developing autologous cell therapies, partners with the centre of excellence for Cell and Gene Therapy Catapult and academic experts in process biomarker discovery (Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria La Fe) and bioprocess sensor development (Leibniz Universitat Hannover). The consortium aims to develop a first-in-class, smart bioprocessing manufacturing platform for personalised autologous cell therapies, implementing for the first time in-line process analytical technologies and smart process control systems. The project exploits breakthrough discoveries of novel T cell expansion process biomarkers and development of new fluorescence spectroscopy sensors for real-time monitoring of critical process parameters, toa enable adaptive process control of the precision TIL biomanufacturing process. After the project, the prototype R&D platform will be ready for follow-up development of the commercial scale bioreactor in GMP environment. 
The SMARTER platform will critically improve production efficiency, reduce overall costs-of-goods, shorten manufacturing cycle times (shorter vein-to-vein time), decrease batch failures and lead to more consistent and predictable cell therapy product quality. Finally, the innovations will enable clinical implementation of a potential breakthrough personalised adoptive cell therapy for hardest-to-treat solid tumours such as lung cancer and melanoma."	bioprocessing; manufacturing; immunotherapy; automation; immunotherapy; sensors; metabolomics	GOTTFRIED WILHELM LEIBNIZ UNIVERSITAET HANNOVER - LUH	FUNDACION PARA LA INVESTIGACION DEL HOSPITAL UNIVERSITARIO LA FE DE LA COMUNIDAD VALENCIANA - HULAFE	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101071054/program/43108390/details	
Smart Sensor Analog Front-End powered by Emerging Reconfigurable Devices	Our main objective is the development of a reconfigurable platform to accommodate both for a generic sensor interface as well as a dedicated sensor transducer element. The tunable analog front-end (AFE) interface should be enabled at the fine-grain level by emerging reconfigurable field effect transistor (RFET) and negative differential resistance (NDR) transistor technologies that provide co-integration capabilities with European 22nm CMOS processing technologies allowing for a More-than-Moore sensor technology approach. Being doping-free these two key enabling technologies provide a high potential gain for a large variety of sensor system requiring a low 1/f noise behavior ranging from solid-state sensors, such as photodiodes, to environmental monitoring for the automotive market, and physiological signal monitoring, such as cancer detection. Having naturally un-gated channel areas, reconfigurable field effect transistors are the perfect target vehicle for functionalized surfaces, e.g. for the detection of colorectal cancer (CRC) biomarkers, serving as a Reconfigurable Sensor Transducer (RST) for the healthcare sector. Together with the AFE, these transducers can be integrated into a CMOS as a use-case demonstration of the flexible platform. To sum up, in SENSOTERIC we will investigate smart sensing solutions in environmental monitoring and healthcare, where both the RST and the AFE utilize the capabilities of emerging RFET and NDR key enabling technologies.

Single Photon source and detector based on novel materials for the detection of endocrine disruptors	"Water is one of the most important natural resources on earth and despite increasingly strict regulations, contamination of water that poses a health risk is still a major problem. In Europe, too, our drinking water is exposed to contaminants such as hormones, which even in extremely low concentrations can have effects on humans and animals and are therefore of interest for water monitoring in the context of nature conservation and also various branches of industry. Our goal in this project is to provide the layperson with a ready-to-use, compact, and robust spectrometer capable of measuring extremely low concentrations in the sub ng/L range. 
To this end, the GREENER project aims to develop new, environmentally friendly QDs capable of near-infrared absorption measurements at emission wavelengths as short as 2µm. These will be singulated by the DNA origami method and integrated into an LED layer stack to synthesize a novel kind of single-photon source. Combined with advanced single-photon detectors enabled by new detector materials that do not require expensive cryogenic coolers but rely on simple thermoelectric cooling, a setup for low-loss, low-noise and high-performance spectroscopy for the Vis to NIR range will be developed. The resulting biosensor will subsequently be evaluated for the detection of critical (endocrine disrupting) contaminants in water in fisheries and aquaponics and will enable end-users to monitor water safety and quality on-side without additional infrastructure or trained personnel."

Single Molecule Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Microscopy for Complex Spin Systems	Nanotechnology is emerging as a key area to address global challenges in health, energy, environment and information technologies. However, we are still investigating most nanomaterials with bulk techniques, averaging over large samples, instead of looking at one single nanostructure with true nanoscale sensors. Particularly, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) as our workhorse for bio/chemical synthesis and medical imaging is inherently limited to bulk samples. The most fundamental challenge, to turn NMR from an ensemble-measurement technique (Commercial NMRs typically have a sensitivity of billions of molecules) into a nanocale technique remains unsolved. In this project we will overcome this challenge by reaching single molecule sensitivity, thus converting NMR into an imaging technique thanks to the exploitation of the unparalleled atomic resolution of the scanning probe microscopy (SPM) technology. This breakthrough will be based on resonant, high frequency, electro-magnetic excitation and readout including important advances in GHz technology. We will use the capabilities of the novel technology to demonstrate detection of single spin NMR and to test the limits of our understanding of nuclear-electron interactions, probing the physics of molecular nanoobjects, 1D carbon nanoribbons with delocalized coherent states, and 2D atomically-thin magnetic materials.  This novel technology will not only open up new fundamental scientific insights but should also have a strong impact in the markets of NMR and SPM. In this context, the project will be a keystone, demonstrating the novel platform conceived as a versatile upgrade for commercially-available SPMs, that can routinely operate in various environments (vacuum, ambient, liquid) with a variety of molecules and materials.

Simulation Tools for the design of safe and sustainable Lubricants	"SiToLub project aims to develop a digital tool/platform for the Safe and Sustainable by Design formulation of new lubricants. The tools developed will provide assessment of the safety (toxicity to humans, ecotoxicity to environment and workers risk) and, at the same time, sustainability guidance to design ecofluids (coolants, greases, oils)  in a clear and holistic way regarding the foreseeable physico-chemical properties and  tribological performance. 
The safety assessment will be realized by using molecular dynamic models developed by the partners.
The tribological models will allow the prediction of the energy consumption during use by providing friction force values, and expected durability  of the materials by using wear data about the materials in contact with different fluids. they will also provide information about tthe degradation of the fluids in use and the chemical reactions occurring. The models will be flexible enough to predict the behaviour of the materials for different working parameters applied for different applications (wind turbines, electric cars and waterborne) 
This ambitious and forward-thinking system will leverage on a series of tools, ranging from technical evaluation and prediction models (computational models supported by artificial intelligence), combined with  established Life-Cycle Analysis (LCA) methodologies to consider the environmental, social and economic impact.
The project will move in close collaboration with already funded European projects as i-Tribomat (H2020 G.A. 814494) for the creation of a OiTB for tribological materials, OntoCommons (H2020 G.A. 958371) for the standardisation of data documentation across all domains related to materials and manufacturing and IRISS (HORIZON EUROPE G.A. 101058245), the international ecosystem for accelerating the transition to Safe-and-Sustainable-by-design materials, products and processes."

Silicon and T2SL EuroPean collaboration for a non-dependent supply chain for large eSWIR FPAs	"In the last years, Mercury Cadmium Telluride (MCT) IR Focal Plane Arrays (FPAs) have drastically boosted the observational capabilities of space IR payloads. In the US, industrial production of MCT IR FPAs with formats up to 4K×4K pixels is established, while in Europe, initiatives from European Institutions and most advanced EU manufacturers are currently on-going to progress on large format MCT hybrids such as 2kx2k, though the industrial set-up necessary to support operational space programs remains to be elaborated and matured. As instruments designers are asking for larger size FPAs, EU detector manufacturers are losing ground with respect to US competitors.
T2SL technology is an alternative to MCT for the manufacturing of IR FPAs. In the US, progress on T2SL FPA development led to up to 8K×8K IR FPAs demonstrations, but like US MCT ones, these are not easily available for the EU market due to strong export/ITAR restrictions. Moreover, US ROICs feature better performances and interfaces compared to their EU counterparts.
The STEP project will provide a disruptive European supply chain fully focused on the design and manufacturing of competitive and affordable large format T2SL eSWIR FPAs. STEP will incorporate all steps of the IR FPA production chain: detector design, large scale growth, fabrication, hybridization, large format and high performances scalable ROIC with dedicated features to improve eSWIR space FPA performances, and evaluation of large space prototype FPAs (including space environment evaluation).
STEP will benefit from a European complementary consortium team: Airbus, the well-known space industrial (requirements, performances testing, environment evaluation, space missions insertion and business plan), the European leader in T2SL manufacturing, IRnova (high performances eSWIR T2SL design & characterization, FPA space prototype manufacturing and non-space applications insertion), a world class RTO, Fraunhofer IAF (T2SL manufacturing and characterization), and a leader in aerospace research ISAE-SUPAERO (high performance large format ROIC design & validation and establishment of a EU large format digital space ROIC line)."

Scale-resolving Simulations for Innovations in Turbomachinery Design	"Sci-Fi-Turbo aims to revolutionise the aero engine design process by advancing and integrating high-order scale-resolving simulations (SRS) and optimization methodologies into standard industrial workflows. SRS are a key enabler for developing ultra-efficient propulsion systems that drastically reduce GHG emissions by 2035 and achieve the EU's target to be climate-neutral by 2050. The advancements will boost design process capabilities and reduce product development cycles.  

Future engine concepts require opening up the design space and solving complex design problems out of reach for today's standard industrial design processes within the required timeframe. To achieve the necessary step change in engine design, a similar step change is needed for the design approach. Sci-Fi-Turbo fills this urgent need by exploiting opportunities in three foundation technologies: High-performance computing, high-order numerical methods, and AI/ML. The combination is used to implement and demonstrate two key advancements. First, a highly integrated high-order SRS design process is established for modern CPU/GPU hardware, meeting robustness, accuracy, and turnaround time requirements. It will provide increased functionality and effectivity at an industrial level and pave the way for the uptake of SRS-based design by the industry. The high accuracy of the methodology will also reduce the need for low-TRL testing and enable new concepts and extended operating conditions. Second, an SRS-assisted multi-fidelity, data-driven optimisation framework is developed, which embeds and exploits the advantages of highly accurate high-order SRS while leveraging AI/ML methods to increase the predictive capability of lower-fidelity simulations and maximize overall process accuracy and speed. Dedicated experiments support the technology advancement and will enable the design of net-zero-emission engines in due time and contribute to the digital transformation of the aviation industry.

We expect to achieve a 2500x gain in energy-efficiency to break the POPS/W barrier with respect to the state-of-the-art CMOS accelerators and predictions for other emerging technology AI hardware. To do so, five ambitious specific objectives have been selected:
- multi-level functionality in hafnia-based thin films by investigating the optimum trade-off in memory window, film thickness & stability of the ferroelectric state
- low operating voltage for the non-volatile memory and robust multilevel operation of the FeFET-2 for high density logic operations and data storage. A low operating voltage is mandatory for power rating reduction, while robust multilevel operation is essential for analogue in-memory computing at the edge.
- integration and characterization of multi-level, low voltage, FeFET-2 arrays
- definition, design and demonstration of a low power FE AI accelerator suitable for scalable systems integration
- Systems simulation of ultra-low power FE accelerator enhanced edge processing for targeted edge applications of voice and image recognition
Ferro4EdgeAI is a multidisciplinary project engaging 12 partners from 6 countries covering the academic and industrial worlds (including 2 SMEs). An implementation plan is presented in the form of 6 work packages, 5 of which are technical in nature.

Safe System for radical improvement of road safety in low- and middle-income African countries	The primary objective of the AfroSAFE project is to make a significant progress in propagation of the Safe System modus operandi within the road safety work context in African countries. This is reached by exposing the local practitioners and decision makers to the state-of-the-art knowledge and practices within road safety management based on Safe System principles, as well as supporting them by sharing necessary knowledge, tools and methods for road safety improvement—adjusted to the African conditions and in tight cooperation with the local actors. More specifically, this is reached through mapping of the existing regulations, procedures, methods and tools within all five pillars of road safety (management, safe infrastructure, safe vehicles, safe road users and post-crash care), development of the recommendations for improvements and running a series of pilots and demonstrations to illustrate these recommendations in action. In these activities, the problems and needs of the vulnerable road users will receive particular attention. Another focus area for the AfroSAFE project is capacity building through education of the local educators in all areas relevant for road safety. Together with them, the current curriculums are revised, new educational programmes created, and an educational platform—a virtual centre of excellence—will be created.

SUstainable Photo-ElectRochemical VALorization of flue gases	"In the road to sustainability, the treatment of post-combustion emissions is still far from being techno-economically viable. On one end, the low concentration of CO2 in these streams, precludes the use of current carbon capture (CC) technologies. On the other end, even if CC were successfully implemented, there are not plausible final uses, maybe except geological long-term storage. Our ambitious proposal aims to investigate the viability of a technology able to tackle these challenges at once. Our SUPERVAL technology will develop scientific solutions from low-cost, non-critical raw materials and processes, with the added value of removing/valorizing the NOx contaminants from flue gas.
We propose to design and realize an autonomous, solar-powered installation able to capture harmful emissions from flue gas, and valorize them as commodities for the chemical industry, using water as sacrificial source of electrons and protons. The CO2 will be transformed into an organic, energy-rich molecule (formate). The NOx will be also captured and transformed, in combination with N2, into ammonia using the hydrogen obtained in the CO2 co-electrolysis processes. This integrated effort will offer the comprehensive capture and valorization of carbon and nitrogen components in post-combustion emissions, thus limiting pollutants and resulting in added-value chemicals. The corresponding techno-economic analysis and life cycle assessment studies will help to shape the components and performance of SUPERVAL as a useful technological advancement in the search for zero net emissions."	road to zero emissions; post-combustion capture; flue gas; CCU; ammonia; LCA	FUNDACIO PRIVADA INSTITUT CATALA D'INVESTIGACIO QUIMICA - FUNDACION PRIVADA INSITUTO CATALAN DE INVESTIGACION QUIMICA ICIQ	2.-0 LCA CONSULTANTS APS - 2.-0 LCA; CONSORZIO INTERUNIVERSITARIO NAZIONALE PER LA SCIENZA E TECNOLOGIA DEI MATERIALI -	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101115456/program/43108390/details	
SUPRAMOLECULAR AGENTS AS RADIOTHERANOSTIC DRUGS	"From diagnostic applications in the quantification and characterisation of biomarker expression in cancer patients, through to molecularly targeted radionuclide therapy, radiopharmaceuticals are at the frontline of modern personalised medicine. The radical long-term vision of SMARTdrugs is to harness the untapped potential of supramolecular chemistry to create a new class of therapies - radiotheranostics - which combine both diagnostic and therapeutic radionuclides in one compound. By using the self-assembly of host-guest supramolecular coordination complexes and molecularly interlocked molecules as scaffolds for creating supramolecular radiotheranostic drugs, new methods for radiotheranostic synthesis that break away from conventional medicinal chemistry concept will be introduced. SMARTdrugs will establish a proof-of-concept demonstrating the utility of non-covalent systems in the design of multifunctional radiotheranostic agents with tailored pharmacokinetics, and their application in challenging drug-delivery scenarios including targeted delivery to cancers of the lung and brain. 

Our 3 main objectives:
Objective 1 – Develop new chemical landscapes using non-covalent bonding to create functionalised supramolecular compounds for cancer-specific theranostics
Objective 2 – Elucidate the key relationships between supramolecular radiotheranostics and the complex tumour microenvironment that determine drug efficacy in vivo
Objective 3 – Perform head-to-head studies to establish a proof-of-principle that supramolecular chemistry is a viable alternative to classical radiopharmaceutical design

The long-term goal is to establish a new chemical landscape for radiotheranostic design, and to facilitate clinical translation of this new technology. Successful experiments will lay the foundations for exploiting supramolecular chemistry in the wider context of drug delivery and theranostics, and for studying biological interactions at the cellular to whole-organism levels."	supramolecules; theranostics; imaging; therapy; cancer; blood brain barrier	TECHNISCHE UNIVERSITAET MUENCHEN - TUM	ASOCIACION CENTRO DE INVESTIGACION COOPERATIVA EN BIOMATERIALES- CIC biomaGUNE - CIC biomaGUNE; UNIVERSITAIR MEDISCH CENTRUM UTRECHT - UMC UTRECHT	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101129886/program/43108390/details	
SUNlight-to-LIQUID - Efficient solar thermochemical synthesis of liquid hydrocarbon fuels using tailored porous-structured materials and heat recuperation	"The European Green Deal aims at a 90% reduction in transport emissions to achieve climate neutrality by 2050. The main leverage of road, rail, aviation, and waterborne transport is increasing the share of renewable fuels. SUN-to-LIQUID II addresses this challenge with an integrated solar-thermochemical pathway that has the potential to produce sustainable and cost-effective fuels at the scale of future demand directly from sunlight, water and CO2. 
The primary objective is to achieve a record-high energy conversion of 15% - a 3-fold increase of the state of the art - by bringing novel concepts (TRL 2) and lab-scale developments (TRL 3) to the field (TRL 4-5). To this end, the aims are the optimization of a high-flux solar concentrating heliostat & tower system, the development and integration of novel 3D structured reactants and implementation of high-temperature heat recovery within the solar-thermochemical system. Detailed scale-up and constraint analyses and a commercial exploitation of the solar-thermochemical fuel technology strategy complement the key objectives for the way forward. 
Through a 48-months 5.7-MEuros valued action, SUN-to-LIQUID II will demonstrate on-sun the viability of the integrated solar fuel pathway on a 50-kW scale, and will create a conceptual design of a next-generation commercial multi-megawatt-scale solar plant. Gathering three research organisations, two industry partners and one SME from five European countries, the highly complementary consortium builds on its unique expertise and unique state-of-the-art research facilities. 
As a result, five expected outcomes of HORIZON-CL5-2022-D3-03-07 are achieved with research, development and demonstration of the SUN-to-LIQUID II technology, and with the system analyses providing the evidence for a pathway towards cost-effective and deep GHG emission reduction especially for aviation, with technical scalability to production potentials beyond projected future demand."	transportation; aviation; emission reduction; hydrocarbons; SAF; sustainable fuel; solar fuel; renewable fuel of non-biological origin; sunlight-to-liquid; concentrated solar energy; heat recovery	BAUHAUS LUFTFAHRT EV -	DEUTSCHES ZENTRUM FUR LUFT - UND RAUMFAHRT EV - DLR; Fundacion IMDEA Energia - IMDEA Energia	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101122206/program/43108390/details	
STRUCTURAL RELIABLE OFFSHORE FLOATING PV SOLUTION INTEGRATING CIRCULAR CONCRETE FLOATING BREAKWATER	"SUREWAVE will develop and test an innovative concept of Floating Photo-Voltaic (FPV) system consisting of an external floating breakwater structure acting as a protection against severe wave-wind-current loads on the FPV modules, allowing increased operational availability and energy output, thus unlocking the massive deployment of Offshore FPV. It will be focused on the research for securing optimal behaviour at aero & hydrodynamic and structural integrity level of the external breakwater, the internal FPV modular structure, the connections, the mooring and anchoring and the whole FPV system, complying with mechanical, electrical (maximizing energy output) and cost-efficiency requirements, ensuring high lifetime of critical components, high reliability of the system and easy, quick and cost-efficient, construction, installation and O&M of the whole system.
This will require:
1) the development of novel circular concrete material solutions for the breakwater, cost-effective, easy to produce and with high mechanical, physical and durability properties and low CO2 footprint.
2) the development of an advanced predictive computational modelling and simulation framework: coupled aero & hydrodynamic modelling, Structural integrity modelling, material properties modelling and Structural Health Management to reduce CAPEX and OPEX;
3) the design and implementation of an optimal testing and validation methodology for offshore FPV system to achieve TRL5, including lab testing, basin-model testing and marine environment testing of critical components assuring high resilience to corrosion and biofouling.
Maximum advantage of existing expertise will be taken from experts in: offshore wind floating structures, material and phenomena modelling (SINTEF, MARIN, CEIT), design and installation of FPV in calm waters (SIS), floating solutions (CLEMENT), circular structural and non-structural materials (ACC) and in social, environmental and economic assessment (IFEU)."

SPIKING PHOTONIC-ELECTRONIC IC FOR QUICK AND EFFICIENT PROCESSING	Rapid advances in artificial intelligence technologies have led to powerful models and algorithms that have revolutionized many applications across all fields of science and technology. Deep learning performed within artificial neural networks has yielded new ways to process data, leading to sophisticated systems with impressive functionality and benefits. However, conventional computing hardware is reaching its limits in terms of energy efficiency and speed. A new approach to computing hardware is needed. Novel brain-inspired or neuromorphic chips working with biologically-inspired spiking neural networks have gained attention as they promise highly efficient ways to process data. Important research effort has been dedicated to develop such neuromorphic systems in electronic or photonic hardware separately, each with its drawbacks and limitations. SPIKEPro proposes a science-towards-technology breakthrough by combining low-energy electrical and photonic neurons into a joint spiking neural network on an integrated circuit. SPIKEPro’s chip integration approach is based on a common technology platform, connecting ultrafast laser optical neurons with efficient electrical spiking diodes through non-volatile synaptic weights. This enables to simultaneously capitalise on the advantages of both electronics and photonics to deliver efficient and high-speed SNNs going beyond existing implementations. In addition to reducing the energy consumption per spike in the network, SPIKEPro will also develop novel learning strategies and algorithms able to work with reduced number of synaptic connections. These will be possible by exploiting the hardware parameters of the electrical and photonic spiking devices. The outcome of SPIKEPro will have lasting economic, societal and scientific impact. The project will bring ultra-fast and efficient neuromorphic hardware into the disparate fields of edge computing, sensor data processing, high-speed control and computational neuroscience.	neuromorphic computing; spiking neural network hardware; brain-inspired computing	TECHNISCHE UNIVERSITEIT EINDHOVEN - TU/e	HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE BELGIUM -; TECHNISCHE UNIVERSITAET ILMENAU - TUIL	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101129904/program/43108390/details	
SPACE Universal Serial Bus	Orbital modular robotic is a key factor to support sustainability in Space. It is then possible to combine modular components to either create a satellite or, in the event of malfunction, to replace a module. To connect such modules, standard interconnects with multifunctional features are required. The standards provide the laws to connect the space along different functional lines including  among those mechanical, electrical, thermal, data and fluidic. For the On-Orbit Servicing market, these standards play a key role to enable space connectors to mate two spacecrafts in a universal and serial way. Several European solutions are already available with a reasonable level of maturity to mechanically connect two space elements and provide data and power transfer. However, there is not a set of common recommendations agreed on by representative European users of space connectors. Considering the huge impact of these multifunctional interconnects at system level, it seems critical to first foster cooperation among them to enable a higher level of standardization to assemble future elements coming from different sources. The main objective of this project is to pave the way for a more flexible, universal and serial interface (USB-type) leveraging the existing standard interconnects for On-Orbit Servicing and assembly applications. After the definition of a standardization level, the design of a universal and serial standard interface will be proposed and demonstrated orienting its features towards compactness, docking symmetry, large docking misalignment tolerances, large loads transfer, data/power transfer redundancy and especially interoperability with other interfaces. Currently interoperability is the only remaining requirement which is not met by any existing space connector/interface. The project will then perform a dedicated experimental benchmark to confirm the achievement of this specific requirement as well as its prospective industrial exploitation.

SKIN MICROBIAL DEVICES	"The long-term vision and ambition of the SKINDEV consortium is to complement the human skin microbiome with Smart Skin Microbial Devices (SSMDs) in atopic dermatitis (AD) patients and other dermatological conditions as a new non-invasive system for future treatment and monitoring of disease gearing up towards preventive care. This idea and new technology are groundbreaking and radical.
SKINDEV aims to make SSMDs generally applicable through innovative technologies like sensing applications in wearables and cameras providing at-home on-demand skin health information. SSMDs will be ideal for early detection and intervention of health hazards.
In this Pathfinder project the focus is on interaction at three steppingstones (SS), towards a prototype SSMD with proof-of-concept for the coupling of sensing and actuation in Cutibacterium acnes (C. acnes) for AD-related inflammatory processes:
SS1. Systems engineering to create a multi-scale computational model of AD pathophysiology;
SS2. Genetic engineering to create sensing and actuation circuits in C. acnes;
SS3. Tissue engineering to create a high throughput skin organoid platform for AD.
A priority of SKINDEV is to translate technological innovations into proof-of-concept novel devices. SKINDEV is expected to invent such new technologies to i) genetically modify skin microbes, ii) create sensing modules and actuators, and iii) develop pre-clinical skin organoids and computational models for host-microbe interactions. The work plan implements an efficient ‘design, build, test and learn cycle’ to accelerate the achievement of sensing and actuating performance fulfilling relevant physiological roles.
Successful achievement of these ambitious goals requires highly integrated interdisciplinary collaborations by scientists working at the forefront of relevant disciplines.

SCALABLE MULTI-CHIP QUANTUM ARCHITECTURES ENABLED BY CRYOGENIC WIRELESS / QUANTUM -COHERENT NETWORK-IN PACKAGE	Today’s tremendous interdisciplinary effort towards building a quantum computer promises to tackle problems beyond reach of any classical computer. Although intermediate-scale quantum computers have been recently demonstrated to exceed the capability of the most powerful supercomputers, it is widely recognized that addressing any real-world problem will require upscaling quantum computers to thousands or even millions of qubits. This proposal focuses on the grand challenge of scalability in quantum computers, from a full-stack architectural standpoint, and enabled by communication networks operating within the quantum computing package at cryogenic temperatures. The QUADRATURE project hence aims to pioneer a new generation of scalable quantum computing architectures featuring distributed quantum cores (Qcores) interconnected via quantum-coherent qubit state transfer links and orchestrated via an integrated wireless interconnect. This novel architecture supports reconfigurability to serve massive flows of heterogeneous quantum algorithmic demands. The main objectives are (i) to experimentally prove the first micro-integrated all-RF qubit-state transfer link within a cryogenic tunable superconducting cavity waveguide in the microwave and THz frequency region for quantum-coherent frequency-multiplex and routing (ii) to achieve experimentally the transfer of classical data through wireless in-package links by integrated cryo-antennas and tranceivers (iii) to build protocols for a quantum-coherent integrated network enabling the exchange of qubits through the coordination of the quantum-coherent data plane and the wireless control plane (iv) to develop appropriate scalable architectural methods such as mapping, scheduling, and coordination approaches across multiple Qcores, and (v) to demonstrate the scalability of the approach via multi-scale design space optimization and for a set of quantum algorithm benchmarks, with at least 10x improvement in overall performance.

SAFE EFFICIENT BATTERY SYSTEM BASED ON ADVANCED CELL TECHNOLOGY	BATSS project will focus on the development of a novel battery system concept which exhibits improved high-performance and safety, as a way to unlock the market uptake of next-generation battery system to a broad range of transport applications. The project will develop a specific Safe-by-Design (SbD) approach to guide the whole R&D process, aiming at identifying and mitigating (even eliminating) safety risks across the life cycle of the battery, while also allowing to counteract possible performance and cost trade-offs linked to the implementation of safety barriers in the battery system. The Consortium will develop a new cell-to-pack modular concept targeting at an outstanding safety and electro-thermal performance, mainly for off-road devices (construction site vehicles) and waterborne transport (maritime passenger e-ferries). BATSS consortium will develop, up to TRL5, the different thermal, electric and mechanical innovations to meet (and improve) the industry use cases performance and safety requirements, guided by the SbD approach and supported by cutting edge modelling and simulation tools for the battery system design and predictive maintenance functionalities of the Battery Management System (BMS). Last, but not least, the end of life (EoL) step will be under the scope through (i) the modular concept enabling easier assembly-disassembly of used battery systems, (ii) the data-supported automated disassembly techniques, and (iii) the exploration of battery system second life in a semi-stationary product.

SAFE AND EXPLAINABLE CRITICAL EMBEDDED SYSTEMS BASED ON AI	"Deep Learning (DL) techniques are key for most future advanced software functions in Critical Autonomous AI-based Systems (CAIS) in cars, trains and satellites. Hence, those CAIS industries depend on their ability to design, implement, qualify, and certify DL-based software products under bounded effort/cost. 
There is a fundamental gap between Functional Safety (FUSA) requirements of CAIS and the nature of DL solutions needed to satisfy those requirements. The lack of transparency (mainly explainability and traceability), and the data-dependent and stochastic nature of DL software clash against the need for deterministic, verifiable and pass/fail test-based software solutions for CAIS.
SAFEXPLAIN tackles this challenge by providing a novel and flexible approach to allow the certification – hence adoption – of DL-based solutions in CAIS by (1) architecting transparent DL solutions that allow explaining why they satisfy FUSA requirements, with end-to-end traceability, with specific approaches to explain whether predictions can be trusted, and with strategies to reach (and prove) correct operation, in accordance with certification standards. SAFEXPLAIN will also (2) devise alternative and increasingly complex FUSA design safety patterns for different DL usage levels (i.e. with varying safety requirements) that will allow using DL in any CAIS functionality, for varying levels of criticality and fault tolerance.
SAFEXPLAIN brings together a highly skilled and complementary consortium to successfully tackle this endeavor including 3 research centers, RISE (AI expertise), IKR (FUSA expertise), and BSC (platform expertise); and 3 CAIS case studies, automotive (NAV), space (AIKO), and railway (IKR). SAFEXPLAIN DL-based solutions are assessed in an industrial toolset (EXI). Finally, to prove that transparency levels are fully compliant with FUSA, solutions are reviewed by internal certification experts (EXI), and external ones subcontracted for an independent assessment."

Risk and Resilience in Developmental Diversity and Mental Health	Individuals with mental health (MH) conditions and their families, especially those with highly prevalent neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), are exposed to high levels of discrimination and stigma, which significantly affects their physical and mental well-being. Our world-leading collaborative group at the forefront of research in NDDs will launch a new project - ?Risk, Resilience and Developmental Diversity in Mental Health? (R2D2-MH). We propose a double paradigm shift to improve the wellbeing of people with MH conditions and their families. We will move (i) from risk-focused studies towards understanding and promoting resilience, and (ii) from a diagnosis-based approach to a developmental diversity approach that will define wellbeing and functioning across the human lifespan. R2D2-MH aims to identify genetic and environmental protective/resilience factors and how they influence developmental diversity and MH. We will investigate at multiple levels two highly prevalent early risks for MH conditions: prematurity and genetic liability for NDDs. Our project has four main ambitions 1. Provide the largest European multi-scale dataset on early human brain development and MH outcomes; 2 Identify biological mechanisms of resilience to the adverse effects of NDD; 3. Co-develop, with the stakeholders, new digital tools to increase participatory research/medicine and reduce stigma; 4. Establish predictive models to guide personalised interventions. R2D2-MH integrates interdisciplinary and complementary expertise across Europe, Israel, and Australia that covers ethics, epidemiology, sociology, genetics, cell biology, neuroscience, computational modelling, Information Technology, psychology, and psychiatry. Our research is highly engaged: it embeds participant and patient involvement in research to ensure that our expected outcomes are truly translational, and will help to reduce stigma and burden for individuals with MH conditions.

Revolutionary high-resolution human 3D brain organoid platform integrating AI-based analytics	"The long-term vision of the 3D-BrAIn consortium is to revolutionize personalized precision medicine for central nervous system (CNS)
disorders, by developing an innovative bio-digital twin model of the human brain that is personalized, precise, and predictive.

In this pathfinder project we bring together three breakthrough technologies: 1) a novel, highly reproducible human brain modelling
technology using robust adherent iPSC-derived 3D cortical organoid cultures, 2) a unique, state-of-the-art 3D multi-electrode array
(MEA) technology for non-invasive high-resolution electrophysiological recordings and 3) a novel approach to analyse and interpret
the large quantities of functional data using tailored automated machine learning (ML)-based algorithms.

With this breakthrough approach we overcome significant hurdles that made it thus far impossible to create a truly representative
and functional model of the CNS for personalized medicine, drug screening and neurotoxicity testing. The revolutionary 3D-BrAIn
high-precision CNS platform will allow robust and accurate modelling of the CNS for a broad range of neuropsychiatric diseases.
Ultimately, the 3D-BrAIn technology will be translatable to multiple other organ systems (cardiomyocytes, pancreatic islets, retina), to
non-invasively obtain longitudinal 3D high-resolution electrophysiological recordings and effectively interpret them.

In this project a prototype of the 3D-BrAIn platform will be developed by growing functional 3D organoids that faithfully resemble
the human cortex on 3D MEA micropillar electrodes, enabling continuous functional monitoring and by developing ML-based
algorithms that can process and interpret the large spatiotemporal data sets. Once all individual components are optimized and
integrated, proof-of-concept will be obtained by validating the platform for two of the envisaged applications: CNS drug
development and neurotoxicity screening."	3D Brain organoids; microelectrode arrays; personalized precision medicine; artificial intelligence (AI); machine learning	ERASMUS UNIVERSITAIR MEDISCH CENTRUM ROTTERDAM - ERASMUS MC	LUDWIG-MAXIMILIANS-UNIVERSITAET MUENCHEN - LMU MUENCHEN; MAX-PLANCK-GESELLSCHAFT ZUR FORDERUNG DER WISSENSCHAFTEN EV - MPG	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101098791/program/43108390/details	
Response of the Earth System to overshoot, Climate neUtrality and negative Emissions	"The RESCUE project will improve knowledge and understanding in area c) of this call: “Climate and Earth System responses to climate neutrality and net negative emissions”, by pursuing two overall objectives: 1) Quantify the climate and Earth system responses to pathways achieving climate neutrality by Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) deployment with and without temperature overshoot, and 2) Assess the potential role of CDR in reducing net GHG emissions, as well as its potential environmental risks and co-benefits.
RESCUE will expand existing knowledge on CDR methods, to design a suite of new global temperature stabilization scenarios at several target values to achieve the first objective. New model developments will deliver improved climate projections with explicit representation of CDR portfolios for these scenarios. The analyses will be devoted to finding suitable pathways to climate neutrality considering multiple aspects of the Earth system response: mean climate and extremes, sea-level rise, global carbon cycling, biodiversity, and ecosystem services. Particular attention will be paid to the reversibility of induced changes by comparing scenarios with and without temperature overshoot. The second objective will be achieved by analyses assessing various factors determining overall effectiveness, impacts and co-benefits of CDR portfolios. These factors include CDR-specific CO2 uptake, CDR-induced biogeophysical climate feedbacks, CDR-derived non-CO2 radiative forcers, and the interaction between socio-economic and environmental impacts (e.g., biodiversity). Moreover, a dedicated analysis will provide key criteria for developing a monitoring system for the effectiveness of CDR portfolio deployments and their potential side effects. Stakeholders will be closely engaged throughout the project to ensure policy relevance and final update of the results which will be made freely available via existing climate services."

Resilient Multimodal freight Transport Network	"ReMuNet identifies and signals disruptive events and assesses their impact on multimodal transport corridors. It reacts quickly and seamlessly upon disruptive events in real-time. It supports TMS-providers to improve route planning resilience. ReMuNet communicates alternative, pre-defined, multimodal transport routes to logistics operators and subsequently to truck drivers, locomotive drivers and barge captains. Through this, it enables a faster and adaptive multimodal network response. ReMuNet orchestrates route utilization, suggests transshipment points and optimizes capacity allocation, minimizing damage and shortening the recovery time.  
What is ReMuNet’s core objective?
As trailblazer for the Physical Internet, ReMuNet pursues the vision to enable and incentivize synchro-modal relay-transport on European rail, road, and inland waterways to increase the holistic network resilience. It significantly reduces emissions and boosts freight transport corridor efficiency in case of disruptive events. 
How will ReMuNet achieve this?
1. A standardized method to describe multimodal transport networks. The proposed standard is derived from existing approaches and developed together with critical stakeholders to ensure Europe-wide practicability and acceptance
2. An algorithm capable of calculating multimodal route alternatives and capacity utilization in the face of disruptive events. It uses real-time data for dynamic synchromodal alternative route planning 
3. A collaborative platform connecting relevant freight operators and enables them to manage disruptions.

Renewable and flexible fuel power generation technology enabling the multi-sectorial decarbonization with Zero emissions	"EU transport and power generation accounts approximately each for one-third of all CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion. While current decarbonisation measures are focused principally on two alternatives: electrification and fuel switching, these are not suitable for the harder-to-abate sectors, such as heavy-duty road transport or decentralised energy production due to payload, autonomy and/or fuel supply requisites, among other issues. In fact, these sectors still rely on fossil fuels for 94% of its energy needs, constituting one of the main challenges to comply with the objectives of the Paris Agreement. 
 
These sectors require a system that allows to exploit the advantages of the use of liquid fuels, as are high energy density, fast refilling and easy transport, but bypassing the efficiency limitations and eliminating CO2 emissions. In addition, to tackle the alarming increase of GHG emissions and the rise of global temperature, it is necessary to deploy an effective solution in the short-medium term. Therefore, it is key not to depend on the construction of new infrastructures and be able to use the existing ones for the transport, storage and supply of liquid fuels. 

The main objective of ALL-IN Zero is to develop a multi-fuel system to generate electrical and mechanical power with zero emissions. This system will feed low, zero or carbon carbon-negative fuels like ammonia, natural gas, biogas or alcohols, into a Compact Membrane Reactor producing a common intermediate temporary energy vector to be consumed in situ by power generation systems such as internal combustion engines and fuel cells. 

ALL-IN Zero will accelerate decarbonisation earlier than other technologies, using available productive and supply chains, SoA technologies, and upstream and downstream treatments for mobile and stationary solutions.

Remote whole-brain functional microscopy of the vascular system: a paradigm shift for the monitoring and treatment of small vessel diseases	Obtaining functional information on living organs non-invasively across different size scales is a tremendous challenge in medical imaging research, as diseases start locally at the cellular level deep into organs before expressing large-scale and observable symptoms. The unique complexity of the human brain adds another level of difficulty for neuroimaging. The cerebrovascular system consists of a multiscale network of blood vessels. Interaction between neurons and this vascular system, the so-called neurovascular coupling, is a major foundation of brain function leading to constant adaptation of the local cerebral blood flow to local metabolic demand. Its alteration is intimately linked to cerebral dysfunction. Current brain imaging modalities are essential for evaluating cerebrovascular diseases in patients but are restricted to millimetric resolution and fail to capture most of blood flow dynamics. Here, we propose to revolutionize the field of neuroimaging by introducing a groundbreaking technology called functional Ultrasound Localization Microscopy (fULM) capable of monitoring transcranially the whole human brain vasculature and function down to microscopic resolution. Beyond opening a complete paradigm shift in brain angiography (at least two orders of magnitude increase in spatial resolution), fULM will also be able to map the functional brain response during task-evoked and spontaneous activity at microscopic levels. We will address major technical challenges of ultrasound imaging, develop advanced neurocomputational analysis methods, validate our methods in preclinical models of cerebrovascular diseases and perform a First-In-Human study. Fundamental understanding of brain hemodynamics and neurovascular coupling as well as early clinical diagnosis of neurovascular abnormalities and evaluation of drug efficacy would tremendously benefit from such capabilities revealing both the brain vasculature and neurofunctional activity down to microscopic resolutions.	functional ultrasound; ultrasound localization microscopy; small cerebral vessel diseases; brain microangiography; neurovascular coupling	INSTITUT NATIONAL DE LA SANTE ET DE LA RECHERCHE MEDICALE -		https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101070917/program/43108390/details	
Reducing the impact of major environmental challenges on mental health	The environMENTAL project will investigate how some of the greatest global environmental challenges, climate change, urbanisation, and psychosocial stress caused by the COVID-19-pandemic affect mental health over the lifespan. It will identify their underlying molecular mechanisms and develop preventions and early interventions. Leveraging cohort data of over 1.5 million European citizens and patients enriched with deep phenotyping data from large scale behavioural neuroimaging cohorts, we will identify brain mechanisms related to environmental adversity underlying symptoms of depression, anxiety, stress and substance abuse. By linking population and patient data via geo-location to spatiotemporal environmental data derived from remote sensing satellites, climate models, regional-socioeconomic data and digital health applications, our interdisciplinary team will develop a neurocognitive model of multimodal environmental signatures related to transdiagnostic symptom groups that are characterised by shared brain mechanisms. We will uncover the molecular basis underlying these mechanisms using multi-modal -omics analyses, brain organoids and virtual brain simulations, thus providing an integrated perspective for each individual across the lifespan and spectrum of functioning. The insight gained will be applied to developing risk biomarkers and stratification markers. We will then screen for pharmacological compounds targeting the molecular mechanisms discovered. We will also reduce symptom development and progression using virtual reality interventions based on the adverse environmental features - developed in close collaboration with stakeholders. Overall, this project will lead to objective biomarkers and evidence-based pharmacologic and VR-based interventions that will significantly prevent and improve outcomes of environmentally-related mental illnesses, and empower EU citizens to manage better their mental health and well-being.

REcycling of low Value components using high purity pre-treatment, dIrecT recycling And green hydrometallurgical approaches for recycling of Lithium Ion and Sodium Ion BatteriEs	"REVITALISE delivers a holistic solution for green, low-cost, and low environmental impact recycling of NMC (Hi-Ni), LFP and Na-Ion batteries, representing 85% of battery waste streams up to 2025. REVITALISE develops low-cost and green processes to recover a full range of battery materials, including NMC, LFP, Al, Cu, Li, graphite, fluorides, phosphates and plastics.
Overall recycling rates of 91%+ will be proven at TRL4 for waste processed from post-production scrap and end-of-life battery black mass. REVITALISE will develop innovative pre-treatment technologies based on electrohydraulic fragmentation, ultrasonication and magnetic, and electrostatic separation that will achieve very high levels of material stream purity. This will enable commercially viable recycling of low-value parts. The approach will enable direct recycling of 40% of the cathode and anode active parts, with direct characterisation of the lithiation (or sodiation) being developed that will be used as a basis of a smart-reformation approach for reclaimed active materials. The remaining 60% being suitable for hydrometallurgical recycling based on leaching with green organic acids from food waste, such as vitamin C (ascorbates), vinegar (acetate) and citric acid (citrates) and inorganic acids produced from industrial wastes.
A further innovation is the development of water remediation with Li recovery from all wastewater streams generated, through the implementation of polymeric nanocomposite membrane separation with direct Li recycling for Li in water concentrations down to 0.6mg/L.
The recycled parts will be assessed for (closed-loop) battery and other secondary applications for precursors and semi-products by industrial partners Verkor and Hydro, through reformulation and upcycling of battery materials and validation of remanufactured batteries. 
An optimised process flow will be determined to achieve commercially viable recycling with maximised recovery rates and minimal environmental impact."

REPRESSIT: A novel class of clinical immune checkpoint inhibitors	"In the tumor microenvironment, continuous or “tonic” stimulation of T cells induces checkpoint signaling through inhibitory immune receptors (IRs). This phenomenon suppresses T cell function, contributing to an exhaustion phenotype and their consequent failure to eliminate cancer cells. Checkpoint blockade through IR-targeting antibodies (e.g. anti-PD-1, anti-CTLA-4) can partially reverse this process, and has revolutionized cancer immunotherapy. However, a large fraction of patients, e.g. with tumors that do not express IR ligands, do not benefit from this treatment. Thus, a large unmet need remains to be addressed.
We aim to change the current ligand-centric “blockade” paradigm. The REPRESSIT platform technology developed herein will provide a radically new approach, through development of a novel class of ligand-independent checkpoint therapeutics. These Receptor Inhibition by Phosphatase Recruitment (RIPR) molecules recruit tyrosine phosphatases to the IR and shut down IR signaling, thereby reactivating exhausted T or NK cells to effectively clear cancer cells.
The REPRESSIT consortium unites unique complementary expertise and models in IR biology, tumor immunology, protein engineering, biophysics and proteomics, to: 1) define the design principles of RIPR molecules against multiple checkpoint IR targets, 2) evaluate the IR mode of action of signal inhibition, 3) optimize RIPR molecule for their efficacy using preclinical cancer models, and 4) demonstrate in vivo proof-of-concept (PoC)), focusing on a highly-relevant panel of T and NK cell IRs known to display tonic signaling.
REPRESSIT will deliver a technology platform for off-the-shelf RIPR designs targeting phosphotyrosine-carrying IR. This project will provide the foundation for our long-term vision of innovative immune checkpoint therapeutics with unprecedented efficacy and provide a greatly improved perspective to the many cancer patients for which current treatment is ineffective."

REAL TIME MOLECULAR IMAGER WITH UNSURPASSED RESOLUTION	Over the last decades, Positron Emission Tomography (PET) has been firmly established as the predominant molecular imaging technique due to its unmatched sensitivity and capability to address many different metabolic processes. However, there is huge room for improvement, as current clinical PET scanners are limited to spatial resolutions higher than 2.5 mm and temporal resolutions longer than 5 seconds. This hampers applications of PET for preclinical research and clinical diagnosis in small tissues or lesions and precludes real-time reconstruction of metabolic images. RETIMAGER is a proposal for a molecular imaging system with a ten-fold spatial and temporal improvement on the reconstructed image with respect to current PET devices. This will not only boost the quantitative performance, but it will enable new applications in cardiology, vascular oncology, oncology, neurology, and other areas. We will achieve this milestone by developing smart radiation detectors with non-conventional geometries that combine the advantages of both pixelated and monolithic detectors, the two dominant and seemingly incompatible technologies employed in PET scanners. Our new scanner will provide 0.25 mm pixel resolvability with time frames as short as 0.01 sec. By aggregating these blocks in a unique gantry self-adapting to the geometry of the field-of-view, RETIMAGER will achieve an unprecedented increase in sensitivity and in in vivo real-time imaging with submillimeter resolution. We will pair it with high-throughput data processing and AI tools to assess with a single tracer both perfusion and metabolism in preclinical and clinical models. In the long run, RETIMAGER’s faster, lower dose, and less invasive molecular imaging technology will become a game-changer for understanding disease processes by unveiling new accurate image-based quantitative biomarkers, taking scientific and healthcare stakeholders a step closer to personalized precision medicine.

Quantum enhANched phoTonic Integrated sensors For metrologY	"Over the years sensors expanded their field of use from scientific exploration to consumer electronics, and their market evolved accordingly. Quantum technologies are expected to further push sensor’s performances, unlocking even more application domains, exploiting non-classical correlation of light and matter to extract the relevant information beyond the limit dictated by classical noise processes, improving performances such as sensitivity, specificity and uncertainty. The ability to produce, control and measure quantum states in transportable devices is the key to extend the sensors’ operating environment, lifetime, power consumption and costs. QUANTIFY fits perfectly this vision and the goal of Demonstrating quantum sensing beyond classical capabilities for real-world applications, in the Strategic Research Agenda of the Quantum Flagship Program. QUANTIFY objective consists in bringing photonic quantum enhanced sensors at the next level of integration developing the essential building blocks and novel quantum-enhanced techniques for future chip scale optical clocks, optically pumped magnetometers and optomechanical temperature sensors. QUANTIFY leverages different photonic platforms combined by a novel hybrid integration technique to bring the key optical and optomechanical functionalities on a single chip. To increase the clock and magnetometer performances, we introduce a photonic integrated squeezed light source, also becoming an important step for realizing a universal quantum computer based on photonics. Finally, we demonstrate a novel absolute temperature sensor with an extended detection range, from cryogenic to room temperature leveraging a nanoscale optomechanical approach coupling photonic and phononic degrees of freedom. 
All the free developed sensors will be assessed using metrological protocols and national primary standards in National metrological laboratories, to foster their feature exploitation in real application for end-users."

Quantum Universal Photonics Integrated Circuit platform	"Quantum technology holds the promise of enabling next generation computing, communications and sensing systems. However, the size, cost and scalability of current devices prevents them from reaching their full potential. Photonics is one of the key enabling technologies for quantum technology. In particular, photonics integrated circuits (PICs) with their wafer-level manufacturing based on microfabrication technologies can provide the reduction in size and cost and enable next generation scalable quantum technologies. To fully achieve this goal, an universal PIC technology that can serve most quantum applications is needed.

In QU-PIC, we selected the Al2O3 integrated photonics platform as backbone technology for the development of quantum PICs thanks to its excellent low propagation loss performance and wide operating spectral region from the ultraviolet (200 nm) until the mid-infrared. A large range of PIC building blocks is developed in QU-PIC, focusing on areas where materials or integration technologies are not yet available. Several light sources, including multiwavelength tunable lasers with operation at 399 nm, 411 nm and 935 nm on the PIC, UVC external cavity lasers emitting at 280 nm, sources of squeezed photons, single photon detectors, programmable ASICs and the required packaging and assembly technologies will be investigated. An open PDK will group all the developed quantum building blocks to accelerate innovation from the initial idea to an actually manufactured system. Two application demonstrators will be implemented using the developed building blocks, namely a source of GKP states for quantum processing and an atomic clock based on Yb+ ions for quantum sensing. It is the ambition of QU-PIC to secure a full European supply chain to establish Europe’s Sovereignty and manufacturing capabilities in photonics integrated circuits for quantum."

Quantum Glass-based Photonic Integrated Circuits	QLASS brings together experts from top research groups, up-and-coming SMEs, and industry to achieve the ambitious goal of producing a quantum photonic integrated circuit (QPIC) utilizing the extremely versatile technique of femtosecond laser writing (FLW) to fabricate 3D waveguides within glass developed for optimum photonic performance to support an unprecedented 200 reconfigurable optical modes. Compared to other QPIC techniques, glass yields extremely small interface losses (<5%) – ideal for modular, scalable architectures connecting multiple chips – with speed, affordability, and optimization for end-user goals. Incorporating high-performance single-photon sources, superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors, and electronics enabling reconfigurable state manipulation via control of an exceptionally large number of cryogenic-detector channels (200) and phase shifters (1000), we will create an end-to-end quantum photonics platform. We will implement Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs), leading candidates for near-term advantage, for which our platform is ideally suited. We will develop software for end users to translate their VQAs into FLW circuits, with error mitigation to enhance QPIC performance. Our principal use case is solving problems in the design of lithium-ion batteries to achieve improvements in capacity and efficiency crucial for attaining EU technological and sustainability goals. QLASS will attain substantial advancement both towards the specific QPIC objectives as well as glass development, with associated novel SNSPD processes, benefitting the wider community and enabling new quantum devices with performance far exceeding other platforms. Our combination of world-class experimentalists and theorists have the complementary expertise to successfully carry out the ambitious project objectives advancing practical QPICs.	quantum photonic integrated circuit; photonic quantum computing; quantum information; femtosecond laser writing; superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors; variational quantum algorithms	POLITECNICO DI MILANO - POLIMI		https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101135876/program/43108390/details	
Quantum Generative Adversarial Networks with phoTonic Integrated Circuits (QuGANTIC)	"The rapidly growing global adaptation of digital technologies has brought an exponential increase in data and computing power consumption, and conventional supercomputers are now reaching their limit in terms of power and energy efficiency. Quantum computers have garnered attention as a way to overcome the struggles of classical computers. Technological progress is happening fast, but the so-called quantum advantage results reported have no meaningful real-world tasks yet, and severe scaling problems remain. An alternative strategy of encoding information in high-dimensional spaces (using quDits rather than qubits) is extremely promising for enhancing computational capacity, accuracy, speed, and noise robustness. However, this approach is still in its infancy. 

QuGANTIC proposes a science-towards-technology breakthrough in scalable data loading and learning with quantum processors, based on a novel concept of hybrid integration on a single photonic integrated chip (PIC). Our innovative target is the first quantum computer using quDits generated by quantum frequency combs with the potential to execute operations in a reduced number of steps and provide the first scalable PIC quantum computer. 

Learning distributions of data and generating artificial samples is a formidable task for classical computers, and we will use our novel quDit PIC platform to demonstrate that so-called quantum Generative Adversarial Networks can solve this task far better than classical systems. 

Our goal will make an unprecedented impact on economy, science and society, as it will predict the behavior of globally critical areas such as energy distribution, weather phenomena, risk assessments and epidemic spreads, by processing vast data sets with a drastic reduction of computational overheads. Our processors have a credible path to market, and QuGANTIC has the right hardware and software Partners to realize this enormous potential.

Quantum Control of Gravity with Levitated Mechanics	The main objective of QuCoM is to demonstrate the proof of concept (TRL 1) of a levitated acceleration sensor and its ability detecting gravity of small masses and in the quantum controlled regime. Toward this objective we will explore the interplay between quantum mechanics and gravity in a parameter range accessible for cost-effective table-top experiments. We will suspend sub millimetre particles in optical and magnetic traps and use those to detect gravitational forces in an unprecedented mass regime. Also, we will investigate quantum superpositions in which these masses are delocalized. We will address some of the most popular theoretical proposals combining quantum physics and gravity in a nonstandard fashion. The proposed experiments will assess their limits of validity and/or further constrain the values of their parameters. The consortium consists of two experimentalists, two theorists, and two SMEs to address the objective. The experiments in question will be performed with optically and magnetically trapped micro/nano-particles based on the experimental expertise of partners in the consortium. Levitated mechanics experiments at Southampton have been already picked up by the EU Innovation radar. In QuCoM we will, go beyond and demonstrate the two-mass gravity sensing as well as the operation of our sensors in the quantum domain. The state preparation, control and analysis schemes are based on the expertise of the theory partners. QuCoM partner high-tech SMEs will help to optimize the experimental apparatus for fulfilment of the targeted objectives, which will in turn put them in a position to offer their improved products in sub mK, low vibration cryogenic equipment to market. The SME  LSI will explore, together with University of Leiden, the feasibility of implementing our technology into a micro-satellite platform for space-based metrology and Earth Exploration utilizing gravitational detection.

PATTERN will thus provide decision-makers, stakeholders, and the public with more realistic and operational ability to systematically assess their policies and their consequences. It will provide a basis for improving (i) methodologies, techniques and models for conducting economic appraisal of climate and environmental policies (ii) the broader policy evaluation framework and practices currently used in European countries and their regions and (iii) tailored analysis and engagement strategies structures for the participation and co-creation with relevant stakeholders and key actors to enhance operational capacities and improve the impact of European policies on climate and environment. Overall, results obtained from in-depth ex-post and ex-ante analysis of the PATTERN’s 5 case studies will bring new evidence on the effectiveness of various types of regulatory strategies, instruments and approaches for climate and environmental policies and insights for the design and evaluation of the implementation of major European policies.	climate change; biodiversity; policy-making; decision-making; operational tools; methods; models; social sciences and humanities	UNIVERSIDAD COMPLUTENSE DE MADRID - UCM	EUROQUALITY SAS -; ISMERI EUROPA - ISTITUTO DI RICERCA INTERDISCIPLINARE SRL - ISMERI-EUROPA	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101056734/program/43108390/details	
Propelling eUropean Leadership through Synergizing Aviation Research	"Aviation sector faces many challenges such as achieving technological breakthroughs, reducing its environmental impact and increasing the sector’s workforce skills while complying with new EU policies and priorities such as the European Green Deal, the new European industrial policy as well as the European digital strategy. A policy-driven European aviation R&I framework is needed more than ever. The primary goal of PULSAR is to support the European policy-makers in identifying the key aviation research efforts to carry out until 2050 and beyond with respect to environmental objectives, associated regulations and expectations of the European citizens. PULSAR will develop the European Aviation R&I Roadmap and will provide associated recommendations. PULSAR will focus on the environmental aspects of the overall roadmap, i.e., on technologies that may affect aviation noise and emissions, both for impacts on climate (CO2 and non-CO2 effects) and for Local Air Quality (LAQ). The project also aims at fostering connection of aviation R&I with education and skills, and communicating about European aviation R&I to citizens and relevant stakeholders. Coordinated by ONERA, PULSAR gathers a multidisciplinary consortium of 12 partners, composed of industrial partners, SMEs, RTOs, universities and an association, relying on a large group of experts such as ENEA and ECATS and clusters whose expertise and complementarity are crucial for the achievement of the project’s objectives. PULSAR will deliver: 
• A R&I roadmap assessing the impact of technologies on environmental issues and stating the R&I effort needed to achieve environmental goals;
• An educational roadmap to guide training of future experts for sustainable aviation;
• A thorough communication towards citizens on how the sector is committed to lower its environmental footprint;

Proof of concept of affordable and scalable DNA data storage by developing a writing technology based on enzymatic DNA synthesis with a very dense semiconductor integrated circuit (CMOS chip)	"The Hyperion project will prove the concept of affordable, scalable data storage with DNA by developing a world beating writing technology based on the precise, robust control of enzymatic DNA synthesis with a very dense semiconductor integrated circuit.
The 4-year research project will further develop a breakthrough approach by the deeptech research-intensive company DNA Script and show that very high-density enzymatic DNA synthesis is feasible. Furthermore, it will demonstrate proof of concept of high-density chip multiplexing, which will be essential to achieve performances commensurate with the best-in-class technologies (>terabyte capacity and MB/s writing speed).

In the course of the Hyperion project, we will rely on fabrication and post-fabrication facilities located in the EU. This will contribute to the strengthening of capacity and expertise in line with the European Chips Act. Once the proof of principle is validated, the Hyperion approach will be the basis for deployable storage technologies that can eventually scale into the exabyte regime and beyond with reduced physical footprint, power and cost requirements relative to conventional storage technologies. 

This Hyperion project will contribute to the EIC Pathfinder Challenge goal by providing a writing solution fit to meet the future needs of a European DNA-based data storage industry.

Promoting co-designed sustainable health interventions with young changemakers for reduced risk of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in urban Burkina Faso, Kenya and Tanzania	Changemaker objective: To implement & evaluate a sustainable health intervention program on health, nutrition, & environmental outcomes for the primary prevention of adolescent obesity & related non-communicable diseases (NCDs) together with adolescents in three rapidly urbanizing cities in Burkina Faso, Kenya, Tanzania. Background: There is an increasing epidemic of adolescent obesity that can contribute to adult obesity, morbidity & NCDs in a broader sense. Sustainable health interventions in urban low- and middle-income countries are critical in addressing lifestyle factors that contribute to obesity, diabetes & hypertension in later life, such as unhealthy dietary habits, inactivity & sedentary behaviors while shaping urban environments. Considering obesity is a complex issue that is influenced by wide range of interconnected factors, such as policy, environment, social, economic, cultural, behavioral, commercial, & biological determinants, a whole-systems approach that converges multiple sectors (i.e., health, education, environment, and agriculture) and stakeholders (i.e., adolescents, caregivers, staff, local government, communities, policymakers & implementers) are needed for obesity prevention in LMICs. Our strategy: Four evidence-based strategies, which will be adapted to context through a co-design process: 1) urban farming in schools with satellite farms and organic waste composting, 2) sustainable health modules for classrooms, 3) linking to healthcare workers through health talks using motivational interviewing techniques and 4) WHO Best Buys: Mass media campaign. Our evaluation: 3 cluster-RCTs in secondary schools, within the framework of urban Health & Demographic Surveillance Systems, implementation, process evaluation & cost-effective evaluation. Our expected results: Evidence of how to implement and scale a sustainable health intervention. Estimate a mean difference in BMI of 0.175 which could lead to reduction of 5% in the prevalence of obesity.

Preterm Brain-Oxygenation and Metabolic EU-Sensing: Feed the Brain	Prometeus introduces a new-paradigm for personalized nutrition of prematurely born neonates in neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), by developing a groundbreaking technology for real-time adjustment of glucose and nutrients intakes to target neonatal brain needs. The brain of a baby born prematurely is highly susceptible to early neonatal injuries that, in turn, increase the risk for neurodevelopmental disability. Provision of adequate nutrients and oxygen is essential for proper brain development and growth. However, current nutritional strategies are unfit to target real-time brain necessities, and are driven by pre-specified (non personalised) nutritional charts, in the absence of contemporary cot-side monitoring of both brain “health” and metabolic supplies. As a consequence, sudden changes of brain fuel-requirements cannot be promptly addressed by real-time adjustment of glucose and nutrients provision. Prometeus will develop a metabolic model of the interaction between the three key brain fuels [glucose, lactate and beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB)] and their effect on regional cerebral blood flow (CBF), oxygen saturation (StO2) and metabolism (CMRO2). The model will serve to individualize brain nutrition targeting “brain health” according to the inputs derived from two novel minimally invasive metabolic sensing systems: a wearable cap measuring regional CBF, StO2 and CMRO2 and a subcutaneous miniaturized metabolic sensor for glucose, lactate and BHB. The system will create a metabolic “womb” to feed the brain of preterm neonates. Prometeus will be paralleled by a parent-dedicated interface, exploiting a purposely developed family adjusted visual language, that will inform parents of preterm babies during their NICU admission and stay. Prometeus will dramatically reduce the risk for prematurity-associated disability in Europe and worldwide, with a consequent incalculable ethical, social and economic impact.	neonatal; glycemic control; brain oxygenation; cerebral blood flow; lactate-glucose-ketones sensor; digital twin; metabolic model; prematurity; visual culture; optical imaging device	UNIVERSITA DEGLI STUDI DI PADOVA - UNIPD		https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101099093/program/43108390/details	
Pragmatic approach to Adoptive Cell Therapy (ACT) using Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes (TIL) in selected solid tumors	The PragmaTIL trial aims to optimize treatment of cancer patients with Tumour-Infiltrating Lymphocytes Adoptive Cell Therapy (TIL-ACT) and substantially expand and improve the clinical implementation of this treatment modality in academic hospitals. To this end, treatment related toxicities, associated to high-dose interleukin 2 (HD-IL-2) required for expansion and activation of TILs will be reduced while maintaining efficacy. This improved tolerability will achieve a better clinical management of patients and enhance their quality of life, both of which represent major barriers for applying this treatment. The objectives of PragmaTIL are: i) To determine whether TIL-ACT using IL-2 analog ANV419 reduces the frequency of Grade 2-4 study-related non-hematological toxicities; ii) To compare the quality of life (QoL) of patients during their hospitalization period, using ANV419 vs HD-IL-2. Also, to compare short and long-term measurements of treatment-related toxicities and QoL co-defined by and for patients and their caregivers; and iii) To develop the health technology assessment (HTA) of TIL-ACT using ANV419, as well as a social return of investment (SROI) analysis. To achieve these objectives, the PragmaTIL project is structured into 6 WP that cover all the requirements to implement the project: WP1) Clinical Trial; WP2) IMPD Coordination, RA and Pharmacovigilance; WP3) Patients as co-researchers and Evaluation of Short- and Long-term PROs; WP4) Health Economics; WP5) SROI, Sustainability and Exploitation; WP6) Scientific Coordination, Project Management, Communication and Dissemination. The global impact of this project will not only reach patients, clinical and translational researchers and policy makers but may help to achieve a better acceptance of these therapies by society at large.

Pollinator-assisted plant natural selection and breeding under climate change pressure	Food security is threatened by climate change, with heat and drought being the main stresses affecting crop physiology and ecosystem services, such as plant-pollinator interactions. Despite the increasing relevance of flowers in sensing the stress, phenotyping platforms aim at identifying genetic traits of resilience by assessing the physiological status of the plants, usually through remote sensing-assisted vegetative indexes, but find strong bottlenecks in quantifying flower traits and in accurate genotype-to-phenotype prediction. However, as the transport of photoassimilates from leaves (sources) to flowers (sinks) is reduced in low-resilient plants, flowers are better indicators than leaves of plant well-being. Indeed, the chemical composition of flowers changes in response to heat and drought, as it does the amount of pollen and nectar that flowers produce, which ultimately serve as food recourses for the pollinators. DARkWIN proposes to track and rank pollinators’ preferences for flowers of a tomato mapping population exposed to heat and drought as a measure of functional source-to-sink relationships. To achieve this goal, DARkWIN will develop a pollinator-assisted selection and phenotyping platform for automated quantification of Genotype x Pollinator x Environment interactions through a bumblebee geo-positioning system. Pollinator-assisted selection for agriculture will be validated by a multi-omics dataset of unprecedented dimensions in a mapping population of tomato, including floral metabolic, transcriptomic, and ionomic traits, as well as mapping candidate genes, linking floral traits, pollinator preferences, and plant resilience. Moreover, DARkWIN will deliver tomato F1 pre-commercial varieties based on the natural biological process of pollinatordriven selection under climate change conditions. This radical new approach can change the current paradigm of plant phenotyping and find new paths for crop breeding assisted by ecological decisions.	plant breeding; plant phenotyping; stress resilience; geo-positioning; plant x pollinator x environment; flower metabolism; natural selection; multi-omics; ecosystem services; source-sink-relations	AGENCIA ESTATAL CONSEJO SUPERIOR DE INVESTIGACIONES CIENTIFICAS - CSIC	DORIANE SAS -; MAX-PLANCK-GESELLSCHAFT ZUR FORDERUNG DER WISSENSCHAFTEN EV - MPG	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101098680/program/43108390/details	
Plankton-like Protocells for Artificial Photosynthesis Targeting Carbon-neutral Energy Vectors	"While mature solar technologies (i.e. photovoltaics, photo-electrochemical cells) cannot simultaneously address the multi-faceted future energy challenge, PLANKT-ON aims to develop a disruptive net-zero emissions technology to both address the global energy demand and reoxygenation of our planet. Inspired by Nature, we propose to assemble the first synthetic plankton-like protocells that autonomously utilise light, water, and CO2 to produce O2 and formate, as a green H2 vector. To this aim, the plankton-like protocells will be shaped as containers of two synergic subdomains mimicking the natural plastids and the CO2-enzyme organelles. The artificial plastid (1st type proto-organelle) will utilise light to oxidise H2O to O2 and reduce a methyl viologen (MV) cofactor, this latter will feed the CO2-rich proto-organelle to selectively produce formate by a cascade enzymatic reaction. We are expecting that this original bio-inspired strategy will open a route to sustainable solar hydrogen.
The long term impact is envisaged for scientific innovation in groundbreaking solar-technology, going beyond the conventional photoelectrochemical cabled asset, and readily exploitable for empowering the EU vision for “Smart Buildings as Micro-Energy Hubs” in the world. Fundamental Research advances will be monitored by PLANKT-ON innovation radar activities, protected by our IP policy and disseminated to reach the expected stakeholders and the general public.
Multidisciplinary collaboration among the 6 partners, from 4 EU countries, 5 research centres, and 1 technology-based company, underpins the project activities that will target the EU mission. PLANKT-ON counts on the valuable experience of its Scientific Advisory Committee where international renowned scientists from Princeton (USA), Berkeley (USA), Tokyo (Japan) and EPFL-Lausanne (Switzerland) will contribute to the results evaluation and benchmarking in the field of light management, photo-catalysis and green H2 transport."

Pioneering Sustainable Recovery in Steelmaking: Hydrogen-Based Technology for Byproduct Management	"The Dust2Value project aims to transform the steelmaking residue recycling process by introducing an innovative hydrogen reduction technology that efficiently recovers valuable metals, such as zinc and iron, from steelmaking residue streams. This environmentally-friendly technology supports the circular economy, reduces greenhouse gas emissions, and contributes to a sustainable future for the steel industry.
The Dust2value process utilizes green hydrogen to reduce zinc oxide and iron oxide present in the residue, converting them into gaseous zinc that evaporates, re-oxidizes with water vapor to fine-dispersed ZnO particles which leave the furnace via the off-gas system and are recovered in bag house filters. Additionally, a secondary DRI is produced. The novel design of the Dust2Value process recovers heat and hydrogen generated during the re-oxidation of gaseous zinc to fine-dispersed ZnO particles, optimizing its energy efficiency. The project will design, construct and optimize a prototype rotary kiln that enables optimized heat transfer and gas-solid interactions, ensuring effective metal recovery.
A key aspect of the Dust2Value project is the integration of digitalization and machine learning techniques for process modelling and optimization. The project will leverage machine learning algorithms trained on kinetic data from thermogravimetry to create an accurate and comprehensive process model. This model will be used for the dimensioning of the prototype and will be further developed into a digital twin, providing a real-time representation of the physical process. The digital twin will enable continuous monitoring, analysis, and optimization of the process, ensuring optimal performance, and facilitating the rapid implementation of improvements. This advanced approach to process modelling will significantly enhance the Dust2Value process optimisation, driving innovation in the field of steelmaking residue recycling."

Piloting Innovative Insurance Solutions for Adaptation	"The EU Member States should step up their climate change adaptation efforts alongside their intensifying mitigation efforts. Next to and in conjunction with physical and organizational measures, that directly reduce climate change risks, insurance and related risk sharing solutions have an important role to play. Innovative insurance solutions and risk sharing are crucially needed to incentivize adaptation efforts, in terms of both volume and effectiveness, while also directly contributing to building more resilient societies. 

The PIISA project aims to develop and deploy a range of insurance innovations that incite households and firms to adapt proactively and sufficiently for their own sake and their neighborhood’s sake. PIISA also incites public authorities to set up adaptation and create adaptation promoting conditions. PIISA co-develops climate resilient insurance portfolios and develops solutions for sharing losses and climate risk data. 

The PIISA project matches scientifically underpinned new insurance concepts with hands-on demonstration of their operability, effectiveness, and acceptability. Extensive user involvement, contextual sensitization, affordability and viability are key features of the new products. The choice of new product developments and sectoral applications will be based on a careful analysis of the adaptation and insurances gaps and their interactions, as well as on deepening product-market feasibility analyses. 

PIISA focal sectors are agriculture, forest sector, and cities and citizens’ well-being, involving a host of climate enhanced hazards such as floods, droughts, forest fires, biotic risks, and various types of storms. The consortium counts 12 partners from 5 countries. PIISA involves 3 insurance companies who will actively participate in the insurance pilots conducted in 8 countries, also using their vast multi-million customer base."

Photon-Atom Non-linearities and Deterministic Applications via arrays	The quantum properties of photons -- allowing low-loss long-distance transmission, multiplexing large amounts of quantum information into a single channel, and operations in standard, room-temperature settings -- yield great promise for scalable quantum computing (QC). However, low interaction is their great weakness for quantum information processing (QIP), as quantum circuits require photon-photon interactions. To date, two-photon interactions have only been facilitated either probabilistically with low efficiency or between individual photons via intermediaries with errors much too large for practical QIP. PANDA has an ambitious core goal of building the foundation for a photonic quantum computer: an array of neutral strontium atoms with subwavelength spacing carefully designed to harness collective effects to implement lossless, deterministic photon-photon interactions. Combined with novel high-efficiency single-photon handling, we will construct a powerful platform for strong, efficient, controllable non-linear operations with many QIP applications. These include deterministic two-photon quantum gates with unprecedented efficiency and repeat rates. We will especially apply our platform to continuous-variable (CV) QIP, particularly Measurement-Based QC, which fully utilizes quantum light field advantages, but has been hindered by the lack of deterministic non-Gaussian photon state generation and is not addressed in the Quantum Flagship. Using our platform for deterministic photon subtraction will address this and, with a CV theory roadmap we will develop, pave the way for photonic QC. Our two-photon gates will also be applicable to Discrete-Variable QIP, placing PANDA in a complementary position to many possible portfolio projects. PANDA incorporates world-class experimentalists and theorists from leading research groups and SMEs with the expertise required to develop core technology that will both yield marketable IPR and fulfill our ambitious objectives.	neutral atom array; photonic quantum computing; continuous variable quantum information; two-photon quantum gates; non-Gaussian optical states; superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors	SORBONNE UNIVERSITE -	FUNDACIO INSTITUT DE CIENCIES FOTONIQUES - ICFO-CERCA; INSTITUT D'OPTIQUE THEORIQUE ET APPLIQUEE IOTA - SUPOPTIQUE - IOTA	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101115420/program/43108390/details	
Phase-sensitive Alteration of Light colorAtioN in quadri-parTIte gaRnet cavIty	The elder wand of telecom wizards would coherently change the color of light. But while the laws of physics do allow mutating the photon chroma, all attempts to date have been very inefficient for large frequency mismatches. PALANTIRI will initiate a technological breakthrough by providing a viable development path for integrating the coherent and efficient interconversion of information between microwaves and light on a chip. We propose a radically new approach building on quadripartite (microwave photon-magnon-phonon-optical photon) hybridization process. The idea is to exploit opto-mechanical effects while inserting a magnetic element that maintains high cooperativity both with a mechanical mode through magneto-acoustic coupling and with the microwave antenna through inductive coupling, while exploiting magnetic texture to achieve perfect matching of the microwave precession profile with the optical mode. This opportunity has recently emerged from progress in material science, which allows the fabrication of freestanding micron-size slabs of ultra-high quality magnetic insulator yttrium iron garnet. The suspension greatly suppresses any leakage of phononic or photonic oscillating energy through the substrate. PALANTIRI’s scientific objectives are to deliver within 42 months a proof of principle on-chip analog coherent frequency converter with efficiency of the order of unity (TRL2). The delivered phase-sensitive device will provide the breakthroughs needed to achieve a radical expansion of the connectivity capacity of a backhaul network for enabling high-speed internet access for everyone from any location. It will also provide the elementary brick to build the quantum-ready internet infrastructure of the future. To achieve these goals, our consortium consists of six academic partners (CEA, MLU, CNRS, TUD, ICN2, MPG) from four EU countries (FR, DE, NL, ES) and one industrial partner (TSST).

Pharmaco-modulation of epithelia for induction of antimicrobial peptide expression: a disruptive approach to fight antibiotic resistance	The MaxImmun project aims at preventing and treating infections, and situations of conflict between the host and its microbiota, by developing a disruptive technology based on molecules that boost antimicrobial peptides (AMP) of the innate immune system. To face the problem of antibiotic resistance, this high-potential technology may be relevant both in situations of endemic infections in the developing world, and infectious or inflammatory pathologies in industrialized countries. Our objective is to establish the proof-of-concept that among a series of hit molecules identified for their capacity to promote AMPs, a small subgroup may qualify to lead molecules that can then be pushed into the late phases of the R&D pipeline, with the perspective of a phase I clinical trial. To achieve this transition, our project will range from the comprehension of microbial mechanisms leading to antibiotic resistance, to the comprehension of AMP regulations, the identification of molecules and their optimization by medicinal chemistry, and the characterization and evaluation of their protective efficacy in pre-clinical validation models. Thus, we expect to develop innovative molecules as future antimicrobial drug candidates.

Personalized Drug Response: IMplementation and Evaluation in CKD	"Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is one of the major causes of death in high income countries and its prevalence is growing rapidly. New therapies for the treatment of CKD have shown clear efficacy at a population level. Yet, individual patients respond differently with many patients showing suboptimal efficacy. This indicates that a ‘one size fits all’ approach is no longer sustainable. 
Currently there are no validated pharmacodynamic biomarkers in CKD that aid in guiding optimal therapy for individual patients. Furthermore, there remains a large gap between biomarker research and actual implementation of biomarker based care in daily clinical practice. 
Thus, there is an urgent need to validate and translate biomarkers as tools for daily clinical practice. PRIME-CKD has a unique advantage to address this challenge as it builds on recently discovered pharmacodynamic biomarkers for CKD treatment, and has access to a vast amount of clinical data, bio-samples. PRIME CKD will: 
1) Provide a breakthrough in the pharmacotherapy of CKD with the validation and implementation of pharmacodynamic biomarkers which will advance personalized medicine. 
2) Scientifically validate innovative clinical trial elements, pipelines and qualification procedures that can be used by researchers, diagnostics industries and regulatory authorities. 
3) Establish a Stakeholder Network to truly engage patients, clinicians and other stakeholders in implementation of personalized medicines
4) Develop a roadmap for biomarker use in daily clinical practice for the optimal treatment of CKD. 

These results will enable clinicians to match patients with CKD with the most effective available drug within the shortest possible timeframe leading to less disease burden and progression of disease, enhanced quality of life and increased cost-efficiency. PRIME-CKD results will thus unlock the potential of biomarkers in healthcare and close the gap between biomarker research and clinical use in daily practice.

Personalised response monitoring in oncology: co-creating clinical trials in advanced breast cancer	"PREMIO COLLAB’s vision is to prolong overall survival and improve the quality of life for patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) by providing refined guidance for managing response monitoring. PREMIO COLLAB strives to facilitate improved patient care and streamlined clinical workflows addressing the needs of patients, healthcare professionals, and society.
Response evaluation methods for patients with MBC have not been modernised for decades, although molecular imaging with FDG-PET/CT has emerged as a highly accurate method for staging MBC, and staging and monitoring MBC has a profound influence on treatment options and the chances of survival. Furthermore, the patient perspective has rarely been considered, although continuous response evaluation in a monitoring setting has interacted with the life of MBC patients for years. Still, no specific recommendations are provided internationally for response evaluation in MBC or in the overall management of monitoring. 
PREMIO COLLAB offers complementary competencies in an interdisciplinary collaborative effort to lift this complex task. In a pragmatic multicenter randomised clinical trial (RCT), we will apply the intervention of FDG-PET/CT-based monitoring and compare it with conventional CT as state-of-the-art. The objectives are to analyse the impact of the intervention on overall survival and quality of life in patients with MBC and include cost-effectiveness analyses directly informing HTA agencies and health policymakers. Building on knowledge from the RCT, we will use participatory research designs to develop improved and modernised patient pathways and digital workflows. AI-based solutions in imaging and liquid biopsies constitute perspectives with a broader horizon.
The work will be done in multiple European centres and living labs with patient representatives, clinicians, and relevant stakeholders aiming to provide knowledge for updated recommendations with a view to subsequent clinical implementation.

Personalised pharmacometabolomic optimisation of treatment for hypertension	"Hypertension, or high blood pressure (BP), is a serious medical condition, and the single biggest contributor to circulatory diseases which continue to dominate as the leading cause of death and morbidity across the EU. It accounts for almost 10 percent of all healthcare-related costs. Systolic hypertension leads to a broad variety of diseases with an immense impact on both patients and healthcare systems.

HYPERMARKER will unleash the potential of pharmacometabolomics to provide a ‘smart’ prescription of antihypertensive therapy. Well-phenotyped cohorts from eleven European countries will provide metabolomic profiles and blood samples for pharmacometabolomic assessments to identify predictors of treatment response in hypertension using advanced AI and deep learning methods. Prediction models for individual treatment responses to antihypertensive medication will be clinically validated and refined through an innovative RCT across 4 sites in Europe. The result is a clinical decision support tool that will give clinicians the ability to make an informed selection of whether the patient they are treating will best respond to the use of angiotensin inhibition, calcium antagonists, beta-blockers, or a range of other existing drugs with evidence-based for BP control.

To ensure sustainability, the project will also develop a framework for the uptake of this tool in routine care for patients with hypertension across Europe and beyond.

Personalised Medicine by using an Advanced Point-of-Care Tool for Stratified Treatment in High Risk Cardiovascular Patients (PoCCardio)	Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death worldwide. Besides established risk factors such as elevated blood pressure, blood glucose or lipid levels, circulating proteomic as well as genetic markers allow further stratification of patients. While some of these markers can be measured routinely in low-threshold healthcare institutions, others require access to highly specialized and costly laboratory environment which usually can be found only within larger tertiary settings. The aim of this project is to advance and tailor a point-of-care (PoC) tool, which was recently developed within the framework of HORIZON 2020. Using cutting-edge lab-on-a-chip (LoC) and microfluidic technology, the tool will be further developed to measure qualified biomarkers and polymorphisms from finger prick blood, in order to help identify, classify and monitor cardiovascular patients at high risk. The clinical validation of these biomarkers and the PoC tool will then be performed in a prospective, randomised multinational trial which will include only existing and approved pharmaceuticals. Based on their specific pattern of qualified biomarkers, patients will be assigned either to standard pharmacological treatment, or tailored intensified treatment. Data derived from the clinical validation study will constitute a rich source for complex AI-powered computational analysis to explore potential predictors for primary and secondary outcome parameters. The trial will further provide the scientific foundation to support regulatory authorities in regard to approval of companion diagnostics, and recommendations for the prescription of drugs, respectively. Overall, this project aims to improve care and treatment efficacy in CVD patients through an advanced biomarker-driven PoC-based personalised medicine. To achieve these aims, a well-balanced consortium of five academic research partners and two SMEs has been brought together.	cardiovascular disease; biomarker; genomic marker; point-of-care tool; personalised medicine; AI	MEDIZINISCHE UNIVERSITAT GRAZ - MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF GRAZ	FRAUNHOFER GESELLSCHAFT ZUR FORDERUNG DER ANGEWANDTEN FORSCHUNG EV - Fraunhofer; IN-JET APS - IN-JET	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101095432/program/43108390/details	
Performance in Robots Interaction via Mental Imagery	"The next generation of personal robotic systems needs to reach a level of cognition and motor intelligence that provides autonomy in any environment, effective interaction with humans, and adaptation of their actions to a broad range of open, dynamic situations. Robots are expected to be able to predict perceptual and functional changes that result from human actions and replicate human activities taking into consideration their own capabilities and limitations.
The required human-like physical performance and reasoning cannot be achieved with the mainstream AI and robotics paradigms, because they are missing the required co-design of body (robot) and mind (AI) and are based on inefficient computing and sensing resources that cannot be scaled up to the required level.
To go beyond what is currently possible, PRIMI will synergistically combine research and development in neurophysiology, psychology, machine intelligence, cognitive mechatronics, neuromorphic engineering, and humanoid robotics to build developmental models of higher-cognition abilities – mental imagery, abstract reasoning, and theory of mind – boosted by energy-efficient event-driven computing and sensing. It will produce a new unifying concept for the next generation of autonomous interaction technologies, capable of more autonomous, faster, safer, and precise interaction with real-time learning and adaptation, thanks to the integration of the capabilities to mentally represent themselves, the physical and social worlds, resemble experiences and simulate actions.
PRIMI’s ambition is to induce a paradigm shift in AI and robotics to create truly autonomous socially interactive robots, which will offer new technological perspectives for transforming personal robotic services.

PYrolysis of biomass by concentrated SOLar pOwer	"PYSOLO (PYrolysis of biomass by concentrated SOLar pOwer) project aims at preparing the ground for a novel groundbreaking and fully renewable process combining concentrated solar power and biomass pyrolysis. Thanks to the use of solar heat in the pyrolysis process, the production of valuable products bio-oil, biochar and pyrogas can be maximized and the associated CO2 emission minimized, with economic and environmental benefits compared to conventional pyrolysis. The proposed system uses particles heat carrier, ensuring operational flexibility and avoiding the need of heat transfer surface in the pyrolysis reactor that facilitates the system scale-up.  

Specifically, PYSOLO process aims at developing at TRL4 the two key unit operations of this novel solar pyrolysis system, namely: (i) the solar particle receiver and (ii) the pyrolysis reactor with the associated particle-char separator. The very innovative feature of PYSOLO lies in its innovative and unique coupling of pyrolysis technology with high temperature CSP system. This ground-breaking feature can potentially offer the following main advantages: 

- delivering solar bio-oil, electricity or pyrogas and biochar for many energy and non-energy uses, when solar energy supplies the heat necessary for the pyrolysis process, either in sunny hours or by exploiting high temperature stored solids; 
- run in self-mode the pyrolysis process (i.e. with electric heating or burning pyrogas and biochar), when solar energy is not sufficient and the TES unit is discharged; 
- providing balancing services to the electric grid: 
1. from the conversion of the available pyrogas when solar energy or TES are sufficient to maintain the pyrolysis process running and the grid requires the generation of additional electric power; 
2. by using low-cost excess electricity from non-programmable RES (i.e. PV and wind) and converting it in high temperature thermal energy via the induction electric heating system.

PROTECTION FROM VIRUSES WITH EPIDEMIC AND PANDEMIC DISEASE OUTBREAK POTENTIAL THROUGH DEVELOPMENT AND CLINICAL TESTING OF A NOVEL CAPSID VIRUS LIKE PARTICLE (CVLP) VACCINE	"The enormous health and economic impacts of epidemics and pandemics has become one of the defining public policy and health issues in Europe and throughout the world.  A new urgency is required to understand, rapidly respond to, and vaccinate against viruses with epidemic and pandemic potential. The major challenge for the modern vaccines is the induction of long-term protective immunity, as clearly demonstrated by fast waning of protection for current COVID-19 vaccines.  VICI-DISEASE is an ambitious project which combines existing cutting-edge expertise in a tried and tested consortium, with new advances in this critical field. The consortium’s main objective is to develop a vaccine candidate portfolio and perform a clinical proof-of-concept study, to enable stocks of vaccine candidates ready for further development (Phase 2&3) in case of pandemic outbreaks. The primary candidate will be Nipah virus (NiV), a high-mortality viral disease with no vaccines or treatments. Our vaccine is based on NiV G protein displayed on capsid Virus Like Particle (cVLP), enabled by adapting template processes from our recent COVID-19 vaccine (currently in Phase 3), and expected to provide best-in-class longevity as shown for COVID-19.

The VICI-DISEASE consortium’s objective is to develop and perform a clinical proof-of-concept study for 
• a highly effective (>90% protection),
• long-term protective (>2 years),
• NiV virus cVLP vaccine,
• by adapting template processes established for our COVID-19 vaccine (currently in Phase 3),
• within 48 months in a Phase 1/2a clinical study, 
• to help protect medical workers and the public from future NiV and Hendra virus outbreaks,
• and establish a pipeline of novel filovirus vaccines through pre-clinical proof-of-concept studies.

PLASTIC WASTE VALORIZATION TO CLEAN H2 AND DECARBONIZED CHEMICALS BY CATALYTIC DECONSTRUCTION WITH NOVEL IONIC LIQUID-BASED CATALYTIC SYSTEMS	"Daily basis used plastics cause a huge amount of waste having an enormous impact on the environment and living species at the end-of-life of plastics disposal. In fact, around 300 million tons of plastic are produced annually in the world and only small percentage, less than 9% according to UNEP, of this plastic is recycled, 12% is incinerated and the 79% left generates big contamination problems. There are already different ways, not all of them economically viable, to valorize plastic waste (PW) e.g., chemical recycling to feedstocks and energy. The smart management and valorization of PW generated is a major challenge to be addressed by the scientific community. Furthermore, the decarbonization of all sectors of activity becomes of paramount importance and hydrogen is set to play a key role in decarbonizing hard-to-electrify sectors, as well as represent a zero-carbon feedstock for chemicals and fuel production. But for H2 to play the desired role in the energy transition, the scientific community must face the big challenge of decarbonizing H2 production at a competitive cost. Consequently, WASTE2H2 is proposing a novel method where innovative Ionic Liquid-based catalytic systems are combined with microwave (MW) irradiation to selectively produce highly pure clean H2 and valuable decarbonized chemicals (solid carbon) from PW, addressing simultaneously PW remediation and global climate change mitigation.
WASTE2H2 add to novelty significant breakthroughs vs. other routes for PW management and H2 production: i) plastic waste deconstruction by single-step method powered by renewable electricity and working under mild conditions; ii) fast production of highly pure H2; iii) valuable solid carbon production as sole decarbonized co-product, with easy recovery for its commercialization; iv) expected long lifespan of catalytic system, easy recovery and reuse; v) reducing significantly the energy consumption due to MWs; and vi) high potential to reduce H2 production cost."

In PANCAID we will therefore develop a blood test for early detection of PDAC. Despite tremendous technological advances in Liquid Biopsy Diagnostics (LBx), this goal is very ambitious because small tumors release only minute amounts of cells or cellular products (e.g., DNA, RNA, protein, metabolites) into the circulation. Thus, tests with a high sensitivity are required but increases in sensitivity are usually achieved on the expenses of reduced specificity which can lead to significant overdiagnosis leading to unnecessary stress for the individuals with a false-positive blood test and high costs for the health system. In PANCAID, we will therefore establish a blood test with high accuracy by analyzing large cohorts of patients with PDAC and its precursor lesions, individuals at risk to develop PDAC and appropriate age-matched control groups (healthy and non-cancer diseases frequent in the targeted population). 
Ambitious objectives of PANCAID include (1) establishment of a unique resource of blood samples of early PDAC and risk groups (WP1); (2) Establishment of a breakthrough blood test for early diagnosis of PDAC (WP2); (3) Identification of the best composite biomarker panel by integrating multimodal features in an AI-assisted computational analysis; (4) Analysis of the socio-economic impact of early PDAC diagnosis (WP4); and (5) Definition of the ethics parameters relevant to early PDAC detection (WP5). A robust multi-biomarker panel will be determined during the training period (year 1-3) and subsequently validated on bio-banked blood samples (year 4-5).  Depending on the outcome of this comprehensive analysis, PANCAID will provide the design of a future prospective study for validation of the developed composite blood test in an international multi-center setting required to introduce LBx into screening programs for high-risk individuals. This action is part of the Cancer Mission cluster of projects on ‘Prevention, including Screening’."

Opto-Electronic Neural Connectoid Model Implemented for Neurodegenerative Disease	"A major challenge facing Europe is its ageing population and associated increase in diagnosed cases of neurodegenerative diseases (NDD). Parkinson’s disease (PD) is associated with tremor and loss of motor functions due to progressive degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the brain. This can lead to memory loss and dementia, which is associated with short- and long-term injuries and disabilities with emotional, financial, and social burdens for patients, families, and society. The exact causes and mechanisms underlying PD are still unknown and existing treatments focus on alleviating symptoms and increasing quality of life, but do not halt or reverse disease progression. Although animal models give unique possibilities to study physiological and behavioural mechanisms, drug development fails due to lack of translation to humans. Alternative non-animal NDD models is needed both in terms of better translation, but also to replace expensive and problematic animal experiments.
We will move disease modelling to a new level and replace animal models, by creating a new concept we call connectoids. We will develop an ex-vivo-type in vitro human opto-electronic multi-regional brain-organoid disease model in which connectoids are formed by precise spatial arrangement of brain organoids connected via hydrogel tracts that promote axonal pathfinding, functional connection, and signalling. By developing 1) light controllable sub-type specific neurons within regionalized brain organoids, and 2) electrodes and waveguides that can penetrate the organoids able to monitor neurotransmitter signalling inside and between the organoids, we will for the first time be able to sense how a particular brain region responds to a certain therapy and watch in real time how signals are transmitted to other brain regions. Our model will not only have health benefit, but will relieve a heavy economic burden on society, and open up for new possibilities for technological and economic development."

Open-Source Cloud-Based Services on EPI Systems	This project proposes to design OpenCUBE, a full-stack solution of a validated European Cloud computing blueprint to be deployed on European hardware infrastructure. OpenCUBE will develop a custom cloud installation with the guarantee that an entirely European solution like SiPearl processors and Semidynamics RISC-V accelerators can be deployed reproducibly. OpenCUBE will be built on industry-standard open APIs using Open Source components and will provide a unified software stack that captures the different best practices and open source tooling on the operating system, middleware, and system management level. It will thus provide a solid basis for the European cloud services, research, and commercial deployments envisioned to be core for federated digital services via Gaia-X. To remain competitive for the European Green Deal, OpenCUBE is designed to make energy awareness a core feature at all levels of the stack, exploiting the advanced features of the SiPearl Rhea processor family at the hardware level and exposing the necessary API at the site level, up to and including interfaces to the electricity grid. This project will leverage representative workloads like those of ECMWF characteristics for production and Digital Twin workflows as drivers for the design and deployment of the cluster infrastructure. We will collaborate closely with the projects developing the virtual environments and the open hardware interfaces for current and future European processor and coprocessor technology.

Open Modelling Toolbox for development of long-term pathways for the energy system in Africa	OpenMod4Africa aims to develop an open Toolbox populated with state-of-the-art models for analysing long-term pathways to sustainable, secure and competitive energy systems in Africa. The Toolbox will build on EU projects like Open ENTRANCE, Plan4RES and FocusAfrica, and will adapt and further develop open models in accordance with the African context and needs. The models are scalable, and can be applied to cities, industries and countries. Furthermore, a main objective for OpenMod4Africa is capacity building among energy models in academia. Four African universities will be actively involved in adapting models and conducting two regional case studies. The additional capacity and the open Toolbox will enable the universities to train new generations of energy modelling experts for the energy industries in Africa. Three decision-makers will also be engaged, together with a network of energy industries and universities in 25 African countries. These players will be invited to use the Toolbox, and to be involved in training activities. They will also be invited to a permanent network of expertise, which will be developed for further capacity building and collaboration beyond the project. Two case studies will develop energy pathways for rural areas, cities, countries and large regions of countries in Western and Eastern Africa. The replication strategies will pave the way for further analyses beyond the project. Finally, OpenMod4Africa aims to collaborate with other ongoing initiatives to maximize the impacts of the project and create synergies. The consortium consists of 15 partners and 2 associated partners. Eight partners are African. Important long-term impacts from the three-year project include enabling academia and decision-makers in Africa to conduct their own analyses for the optimal development of their energy system, supplying energy to a much larger share of the population, and establishing a system based upon the abundant share of renewables on the continent.

On-chip tomographic microscopy: a paraDIgm Shift for RevolUtionizing lab-on-a-chiP bioimaging technology	DISRUPT aims at revolutionising the field of biomedical imaging by developing a radically new lab-a-on-chip technology: integrated tomographic microscopy. This unprecedented technique will be enabled by pushing forward the science of on-chip wireless photonics and tomography, in combination with microfluidics and artificial intelligence (AI). The CMOS compatibility of this technology represents a paradigm shift as it assures the realization of tomographic microscopes that are dramatically cheaper, lighter, and smaller than current approaches. Moreover, the singular features of the proposed solution introduce key advantages in terms of resolution, sensitivity, throughput, parallelisation, and energy efficiency. To illustrate its potential, we will show that on-chip TPM can be used for cancer detection and the identification of infected cells. Developments related to fundamental nanoantenna and diffraction tomography science, nanophotonics, nanofabrication, microfluidics, AI and clinical validation will be undertaken by a consortium comprised by 2 SME, 1 HE, 1 Non-profit RO and 2 Cancer R&D Medical institutions, with complementary expertise, leaders in their respective markets and R&D fields. This novel device is suited for many applications, such as early cancer diagnosis, cell characterisation, research on cancer and infectious diseases, immunocyte phenotyping, stem cell multipotency identification, tissue pathology, haematopathology, and analysis of infected cells. Its intrinsic mass-producible, compact, low-cost, mechanically robust, and energy-efficient feature makes this technology a future innovation driver for new developments in many biomedical application fields, and offers an alternative toolset addressing some of the emerging needs of microscopic analysis and diagnostics in low-resource settings, telemedicine applications and point-of-care, having a potentially huge societal impact fostering early diagnosis of cancer and other diseases and infections.

ORU BASED ON BUILDING BLOCKS FOR ADVANCED ASSEMBLY OF SPACE SYSTEMS	"ORU-BOAS (ORU based on Building Blocks for On Orbit Advanced Assembly of Space Systems) project will develop and demonstrate an ORU concept (TRL 6) based on the Building Blocks developing in previous SRC calls and PERASPERA/EOF objectives. The main points to be developed are:
- An ORU compatible with the different SI, payloads and services  as indicated in the topic reaching finally a TRL 5/6 
- This ORU to be used as ""plug&play"" module for the topic HORIZON-CL4-2022-SPACE-01-11 (In Orbit Demonstration phase)
- To develop a Satellite Construction Kit user cases for future application in ISMA (In Space Manufacturing and Assembly) missions
- The ORU design concept will include an AppStore and Open-Architecture mentality for the different modules as avionics.

The ORU will be designed in a modular concept in order to be flexible and provide capabilities to upgrades in an efficient manner. This project will consider the needs and requirements of current PERASPERA projects: EROSS+ and PERIOD.
The ORU-BOAS consortium is formed by SENER Aeroespacial (coordinator), Thales Alenia Space France, Thales Alenia Space Italy, ISISPACE and DLR.
This consortium has a considerable experience in previous PERASPERA projects: SENER was coordinator of OG5 SIROM and Thales Alenia Space France coordinated OG4 I3DS, OG7 EROSS and OG12 EROSS+.

ORTHOpaedic treatment with ALLOgenic combined ATMP in long bone fracture delayed UNION and non-union (ORTHO-ALLO-UNION).	"Bone fracture with delay or failure to heal is a condition with huge health impact. Although only a small proportion of long bone fractures evolve to non-union (5%), it is a first magnitude problem due to the number of new annual fractures and increasing incidence of complex fractures with high risk of non-consolidation, need for repeated procedures and years of patient disability. Bone autografts, autologous mesenchymal cells, or other complex interventions are used in this setting. 
The aim of this project is the development of a universal therapy for fractures with delay or failure to heal, aiming to a simple and wide access to allogenic cell therapy combined with biomaterial, in a broad number of patients. Rather than considering ATMP only as a last solution in established non-union fractures, this project advocates that the indication should be moved to an earlier timepoint. Patients will be treated with the combined ATMP as soon as the need for reoperation is identified due to delayed healing, with or without an added infectious component, to avoid long-term suffering for patients and their relatives, and prevent progression to more severe non-unions, with heavy personal, social and economic costs. This approach is aligned with the real needs of patients and better fits with the usual practice in the EU, where reoperations are performed at 6 months or before, in an attempt to accelerate bone healing and avoid complications. 
The project will establish a master cell bank for a wide allogenic production with donors selection criteria of bone formation potential. Necessary preclinical and clinical information to support the EU approval of a specific combined ATMP will be obtained. Open access to scientific and regulatory information will be available for other EU medical device companies and cell therapy producers, so in addition to direct clinical benefit to patients and healthcare providers, other developers of combined ATMP products will get benefit."	allo-BM-MSC; non-union	SERVICIO MADRILENO DE SALUD - SERMAS	ASSISTANCE PUBLIQUE HOPITAUX DE PARIS -; BIOMATLANTE -	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101137464/program/43108390/details	
OPEN FAN VALIDATION FOR CARBON-FREE AIRCRAFTS	"The open fan concept has been around for decades. Its high propulsive efficiency combined with the elimination of the nacelle drag and weight has been always appealing to replace high by-pass ratio ducted fans and reduce CO2 and NOx emissions. The CS1 and CS2 programs have made relevant efforts to pursue the contra-rotating open rotor (CROR) concept as well. Though CROR has not made it to market, progress has been done reducing noise levels to that of ducted fans.

Open fans exhibit several differences with respect to ducted fans which by today are highly sophisticated components accumulating decades of research.  The chasm between the OP concept and its product is too big to be covered by a single demonstrator since a wrong materialization of the idea can give rise to misleading conclusions.

Turbomachinery simulations have been perfected for decades and are essential to close the gap between the concept and the detailed implementation of the product. However, open rotors exacerbate existing problems (e.g., blade-to-blade variations even for small angles of attack, strong coupling between CO2 and noise emissions, etc.). Moreover, open fans lack publicly available data or test cases preventing researchers from validating their ideas. 

The first global assessment of CS2 reported an expected noise reduction of -9dB in the innovative TP 130 pax project with respect to the last generation of ducted fans though at a lower flight Mach number. This project aims to obtain relevant noise and performance experimental data of an unducted single fan (USF) for the short/medium-range aircraft with two objectives. Firstly, confirm that about 5-10 dB noise reduction is achievable at the expense of a slight penalty in fan efficiency, and secondly, validate and expand the scope of numerical tools. An experimental database with the key results of the projects will be built to unlock the application of the USF for SAF, Hydrogen, and Hybrid-electric engine and aircraft configurations."

Novel recuperation system to maximize exergy from anergy for fuel cell powered geared electric aircraft propulsion system.	"To achieve climate neutrality in aviation by 2050, hydrogen powered aircraft propulsion can be key. For this, several challenges need to be tackled such as thermal management and heat rejection of fuel cells in the aircraft. For each watt of electricity produced by a fuel cell, one watt of waste heat is generated. Recuperating it to further use would be indeed an asset. The exFan project will target such innovation by including a ducted heat exchanger in the nacelle of the propulsion system. It will use the ram jet effect, called also ""Meredith effect"" (ME) to generate thrust from waste heat. The design of a lightweight heat exchanger and the recovery of waste heat using the ME are promising topics further investigated in detail here. The exFan system will be included in a geared electric fan propulsion system of mega-watt class powered by hydrogen fuel cell technology. The heat exchanger will be a bionic design duly surface finished to hinder particle accumulation, corrosion, and erosion. Additionally, novel thermal management system will be designed, to optimize the heat quality of the waste heat and control the heat flux of the propulsion system. Optimal operation conditions will also be investigated. A simulation model will be set up for operation parameter optimization. First functional lab scale tests of exFan will serve to verify such model.  The breakthrough innovations proposed in exFan will i) allow European aircraft producers to offer savings in cost operation ii) enable European aeronautics industry to maintain global competitiveness and leadership, and iii) create significant contribution in the path towards CO2 and NOX emission free aircrafts. 

exFan brings together multidisciplinary experts from academia, aeronautical associations and industry, supported by a selected technical advisory board. exFan will be in close contact with Clean Aviation and Clean Hydrogen to create synergies and speed up the development.

Novel long-term electricity storage technologies for flexible hydropower	The overarching aim of STORE2HYDRO is to introduce a new mindset for storage of electricity in connection with existing hydropower. Relatively small adjustments to existing hydropower facilities by retrofitting reversible pump turbine technology would allow the European electricity storage capacity to increase by 22TWh/y or more. The aim will be achieved by: i) Validated innovative mechanical solutions to TRL4-5 for larger-scale pumped, longer-duration storage of electricity in existing high head Reservoir-to-Reservoir (RtR) and low head Run-of-River (RoR) hydropower facilities. ii) Mapping untapped hydropower sources for long term electricity storage in Europe increasing the availability, robustness and safety of energy storage solutions. The novel technologies will enable the operators to run hydropower stations in a more efficient, cost effective and flexible manner than today also adapting to the energy system. This is without changing the regulating heights or volume of the reservoir/river reaches following the European Green Deal priorities. Also, turbine manufacturers can introduce new components for cost-effective retrofitting of pumped storage. The technology will be validated with detailed LCA and by consideration of CAPEX and OPEX of potential future plant. The 1st innovation is based on unique design solutions for a retrofittable reversible pump turbine technology enabling a cost-effective solution free of cavitation, enhanced flexibility, and reduced losses. The 2nd innovation is enabled by digital twins including hydraulic and sediment dynamics for pumped-storage. These tools give detailed information about the status of the current storage increasing the availability and robustness of the mechanical storage of electricity in existing RoR and RtR systems adapting to, for example, predictions of generation of intermittent electricity from wind and solar. Practically this will imply new storage of electricity in existing reservoirs and river stretches.

Novel immunotherapies for tuberculosis and other mycobacterial diseases	"Tuberculosis (TB) remains the leading cause of death due to a single pathogen, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb; except in 2020-2022, when it was surpassed by the COVID-19 pandemic), with 1.5 million deaths in 2020. The lengthy TB treatment and the numerous adverse events contribute to poor medical adherence and development of antibiotic resistant strains. Thus, novel therapeutic modalities are urgently needed to shorten treatment duration, improve outcomes and control the emergence of drug resistant TB. 
The ITHEMYC project convenes a multidisciplinary consortium of 11 partners, including two Product Development Partnerships (TBVI, TB-Alliance) and an industrial partner (GSK) involved in vaccine, drug and biomarker R&D for TB. The partners will work jointly to develop innovative adjunctive TB immunotherapies by capitalizing on a promising pipeline and recent developments in the field. The project will combine current and new antibiotic regimens with novel immunotherapies, such as small molecules targeting host pathogen-interactions, including host-directed therapies and virulence inhibitors, immunomodulatory compounds, monoclonal antibodies and therapeutic vaccines. The project will generate robust preclinical safety and efficacy information on compounds and combinations through a set of relevant in vitro, in vivo and in silico models, and progress two of them up to preclinical proof-of-concept in non-human primates within the project duration. The partners are proposing a critical path for characterization and progression of immunotherapies, that will be refined based on knowledge generated in ITHEMYC aiming to increase the understanding and interest for this emerging concept of adjunctive TB immunotherapy. We expect the new combined interventions will improve TB cure rates, reduce the duration and toxicity of current regimens and reduce relapse rates.

Novel advanced and repurposed therapeutics for vision restoration in a group of severe rare ocular surface diseases: from validation to first clinical investigations	"Rare Eye Diseases (REDs) are a major cause of visual impairment and blindness in Europe, affecting patients of all ages. The RESTORE VISION Consortium identified a group of 7 REDs all affecting the cornea and ocular surface that cause severe vision impairment and blindness and have inadequate treatment options today. Onset and progression is characterised by overlapping common pathophysiologic mechanisms: defective corneal wound healing, nerve degeneration, stem-cell dysfunction and aberrant vessel ingrowth. The 7 REDs targeted are Aniridia-Associated Keratopathy, Neurotrophic Keratopathy, Limbal Stem Cell Deficiency, Ocular Cicatricial Pemphigoid, EEC Syndrome, Ocular Graft versus Host Disease and Corneal Neovascularisation, affecting over 500k patients in Europe.
Current management is often prohibitively expensive, has low efficacy and leads to debilitating side effects, pointing to a critical medical problem and area of unmet medical need. RESTORE VISION brings together actors from across the full value chain: 6 leading research institutions, 3 SMEs and a European patient organisation. We take a ground-breaking approach to improve eye health by verifying disease pathomechanisms, using cutting-edge models for each rare disease to test novel and repurposed compounds and determine drug mechanisms of action, formulating compounds as safe eye drop suspensions or subconjunctival drugs, and performing several first-in-human trials of novel therapies.
New therapeutics with game-changing potential will be evaluated for the first time. Our pioneering ‘streams’ approach is based on the repurposing of 6 existing drugs and the development of 3 new compounds, all with solid preliminary data showing remarkable effects in restoring the cell physiology, immune, avascular, neural and signalling environment in the cornea. This innovative approach shortcircuits lengthy and complex regulatory and drug development processes, ensuring rapid translation into the clinic."	cornea; rare eye disease; stem cells; stem cell deficiency; nerve regeneration; wound healing; aniridia; neurotrophic keratopathy; graft versus host disease	UNIVERSITY OF GALWAY - OLLSCOIL NA GAILLIMHE	ANIRIDIA EUROPE -; Catalyze B.V. -	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101080611/program/43108390/details	
Novel Fuel-Flexible ultra-Low Emissions Combustion systems for Sustainable aviation	"Improving Local Air Quality at airports while at the same time decarbonising aviation can be achieved by switching to sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs) and hydrogen (H2), as confirmed by recent engine development programs. However, both these fuels require significant developments in the gas-turbine combustor because present technologies not only to further reduce NOx and PM emissions as expected by long-term standards and objectives but also are not normally suitable for 100% direct combustion of hydrogen. In this project, revolutionary combustor architectures will be studied, extending the preliminary results of previous Clean Sky 2 ""Innovative NOx Reduction Technologies"" projects in terms of scientific scope and TRL. In particular, this project will advance (i) the Lean Azimuthal Flame (LEAFinnox), a novel combustion system based on Flameless Oxidation, (ii) the Compact Helically Arranged combustoR (CHAIRlift), a new system which uses interacting lean lifted flames, and (iii) plasma and electric manipulation of the spray and of the flame stabilisation mechanism. The fuel flexibility offered by these novel concepts is key to allow for SAF and H2 operations. This unique feature will be exploited to give novel dual-fuel LTO cycle strategies and ultra-low NOx, ultra-low soot single or dual-fuel use. Experiments on available dedicated rigs and numerical work will be performed to provide knowledge at the fundamental and practical level that will allow TRL3 and higher developments at the end of the project. The project will include new CFD, low-order, and AI models, and novel stabilisation techniques ripe for commercial exploitation."

Next Generation Glioma Treatments using Direct Light Therapy	Glioma is an extremely lethal cancer, due largely to the inaccessible nature of the brain and diffusion of cells from the tumour site. These diffuse cells are usually too deeply embedded in the brain to safely remove by current means. Targeted Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) generation is a promising form of glioma treatment to selectively eliminate glioma, including diffuse cells. However, the only current means of targeted ROS generation is photodynamic therapy (PDT) which generates ROS using expensive and potentially toxic photosensitisers (PS) which are ineffective against distant diffused cells and introduce many treatment limitations. GlioLighT proposes a novel alternative form of targeted ROS generation: Direct Light Therapy (DLT). DLT uses 1267nm light to generate 1O2 species in glioma cells without dependency on a PS. The removal of PS will revolutionise glioma treatment, enabling novel treatment modalities to vastly improve efficacy, earlier intervention options, all at reduced cost and complexity. However, whilst the principles of DLT have been demonstrated, little is known about how DLT achieves its anti-cancer effects, or the extent of its therapeutic benefits. Leveraging decades of accumulated PDT knowledge and technology development, GlioLighT will study DLT technology both independently and compared to PDT. The effect of DLT on glioma and the brain, focusing on immunogenicity, will be studied to determine DLT’s efficacy, safety, and mechanisms of action. Novel ultrashort pulse (USP) light sources will be developed to maximise optical penetration and minimise safety risk, ensuring DLT is suited for clinical adoption. Lastly, the development of the preclinical GlioLighT delivery and sensing system (pcGlio-DSS) ready for the next steps of clinical translation, will bring DLT a leap closer to vastly improving glioma treatment in Europe and worldwide.

Next Generation 3D Tissue Models: Bio-Hybrid Hierarchical Organoid-Synthetic Tissues (Bio-HhOST) Comprised of Live and Artificial Cells.	"Bio-HhOST will build bio-hybrid materials that comprise living & artificial cells, in dynamic communication, such that artificial cells may influence the proliferation, differentiation and function of living cells.  This will be accomplished by producing precision engineered, microscale, liquid and lipid bilayer-based, chemically compartmentalised artificial cells, co-localised with live cells. This will be done by an interdisciplinary team of biologists, engineers, mathematicians and entrepreneurs. The artificial cells will contain functional metabolisms, and the ability to respond to chemical stimuli in the environment to release signaling molecules, on demand, to regulate the neighboring living cells, as found in complex biological tissues. These new chemically programmable organoid-synthetic tissues will enable a paradigm shift, in both ability to elucidate and control the complexity of physio-chemical interactions within 3D tissues, and reduce animal use in pharmaceutical R&D.
To achieve these ambitions we have designed an integrated multistage workplan driving towards the following overarching aims:- Aim 1. Create 3D tissues where spatial regulation of living cell differentiation is determined by co-located (chemically programmable) artificial cells. Aim 2. Regulate and maintain such 3D tissues by dynamic communication between live and artificial cells. Aim 3. Develop multi-level, multi-approach models of organoid-synthetic tissues behavior. These will be applied to target applications; Aim4. Evaluating drug delivery vectors for next generation biological therapeutics. And Aim5. generation of complex tissues formed of distinct different regions, not achievable with current organoid protocols. These exemplify our wider ambitions for the Bio-HhOST approach including to, i) understand cell behavior in increasingly realistic 3D tissue models, ii) elucidate targets for the treatment of disease, and iii) enable the reduction of animal use in pharmacuetical research."

NEWGEN delivers new space charge mitigating additives for extruded HVDC insulation materials, as well as new industrial cable extrusion solutions for defect-free and cost-effective manufacturing of next generation thermoplastic HVDC cables. Moreover, NEWGEN will provide online global condition monitoring and novel pre-fault detection methods and instruments for assessing the health status of extruded HVDC cable systems, as well as comprehensive tools and models for the evaluation of life and reliability of extruded HVDC cable systems (cable, joints and terminations) under realistic operation conditions within HVAC/-DC grids (model demonstration via grid-simulations). The new sustainable insulation materials and extrusion solutions will contribute to improved dielectric performance and reliability of extruded insulations needed for reaching TRL maturity for higher rated voltages up to ±600 kV. The uniqueness of the NEWGEN concept is that it is not limited to any specific insulation compound or HV cable manufacturer, but rather the results will impact the whole European HV cable industry for reaching the next generation of reliable-by-design extruded HVDC cables. Moreover, the NEWGEN innovations for online condition monitoring and reliability modelling of HVDC cable systems will allow European transmission system operators (TSOs) to perform comprehensive monitoring and proactive maintenance for their HVDC cable system assets, and to ensure satisfactory firewall properties against disturbances in the hybrid AC/DC network.

New bio-based and sustainable raw materials enabling circular value chains of high performance lightweight biocomposites	"New lightweight High-Performance Composite (HPC) materials and efficient sustainable processing technologies will have an enormous environmental and performance benefit in all sectors of application. However, current sustainable HPC application is limited to large sectors due to their limitations in terms of long processing times, high prices and low recyclability. To overcome these limitations, r-LightBioCom propose a paradigm shift in the way HPC are manufactured and recycled, unlocking sustainable-by-design production of lightweight HPC. Therefore, the project will enable new circular value chains towards r-LightBioCom results, contributing to environmental-related EU goals and reducing the HPC waste generation and the use of non-sustainable fossil resources.

To this end, a sustainable catalogue of new advanced biobased and recycled HPC materials will be initially developed with inherent recyclability properties (at least 3 new types of bio-resins, 4 new biomass-derived nanofillers and additives, and 3 families of sustainable fibre-based textile products). To reduce current associated manufacturing costs and high energy consumptions and emissions, efficient processing techniques will be developed (2 new fast curing techniques) combined with recycling technologies for the new catalogue of materials to reduce waste generation and induce circularity.  

A new open method and related tools (Coupled Ecological Optimisation framework) will promote and standardise holistic sustainable HPC design, modelling and systematic optimisation, leading to continuous sustainable catalogue growth and inclusion of new families of biobased, recyclable lightweight HPC at competitive cost. All results will be validated in 3 use cases at automotive, infrastructure and aeronautic industries with specific business cases, contributing to establishing new resilient, sustainable and innovative value chains in the EU HPC industry, promoting a change of paradigm from linear to circular ones."

Neuromorphic computing Enabled by Heavily doped semiconductor Optics	NEHO will develop a novel photonic integrated circuit platform that enables ultrafast and low-energy consumption neuromorphic information processes by means of a newly developed nonlinear photon-plasmon semiconductor technology at mid-infrared wavelengths (8-12 μm). NEHO vision will be achieved by unconventional use of semiconductors to optimize and control plasmonic effects that will provide the optical nonlinearity required to implement the functionalities of an artificial neuron. NEHO's optical neuron will be the building block for the realization of ultrafast optical neural networks.  We will combine the flexibility of field-effect devices realized on semiconductors with the nanoscale nature of plasmonic processes so to enable the reconfigurability of the nonlinear optical coefficient at each node of the network, simply obtained by controlling DC electric potential levels. At the heart of NEHO is the idea of exploiting the rich electron dynamics of semiconductors. Doped semiconductors undergo an interesting transition from the size-quantization regime to the classical regime of plasmon oscillations. This transition region can exhibit strong nonlocal and nonlinear optical response due to a large variety of electron-electron interactions. The decrease in electron density induced on the semiconductor surface by an external bias can be used to modulate the nonlinear response strength. This unprecedented feature will be used to leverage the hardware implementation of a neural network into the development of new machine learning optimization techniques, including the optimization of the nonlinear activation function to different tasks. This extra degree of freedom will offer tremendous benefits for a large variety of machine learning applications.	optical neural networks; hybrid photonics-plasmonics; reconfigurable optical nonlinearity; semiconductor plasmonics; hydrodynamic nonlinearity	FONDAZIONE ISTITUTO ITALIANO DI TECNOLOGIA - IIT	CENTRE NATIONAL DE LA RECHERCHE SCIENTIFIQUE CNRS - CNRS; CONSIGLIO NAZIONALE DELLE RICERCHE - CNR	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101046329/program/43108390/details	
Nanomedicine Approach to Normalize Erythrocyte Maturation in Congenital Anemia by messenger RNA	Messenger RNA (mRNA) has recently proven itself as a prophylactic modality that can be rapidly developed and employed with high efficacy and low toxicity. Compared to DNA-based gene therapy, mRNA has significant advantages including higher intrinsic safety (non-integrating), lower cost of development, and less stringent regulatory requirements for clinical approval. In the NANEMIAR project, we take advantage of these benefits to kill 2 birds with 1 stone: first, we develop a first-of-its-kind nanomedicine for congenital anemia, a group of rare, inherited blood disorders characterized by ineffective red blood cell production. Our proposed bone marrow-targeted mRNA-based therapy contributes to the first Horizon Europe strategic plan (2021-2024) for new and advanced therapies for non-communicable diseases and is expected to be a vast improvement over current treatment options in terms of efficacy and safety. Second, we provide critical knowledge on targeted non-viral polynucleotide delivery, with a platform that can be exploited for next-generation cell and gene therapy in a broader context. To achieve this, our consortium combines the unique cell-targeting and mRNA knowledge from the Dutch Biotech Mercurna with two excellent research partners (from Spain and France) who have demonstrated expertise in the field of anemia. By focusing on the well-recognized rare disease model, beta-thalassemia, and combining an established mouse model, patient material, and previous drug development experience we build a convincing case to treat congenital anemia.  	mRNA; erythropoiesis; lipid nanoparticles; targeting; health; congenital anemia	FUNDACION PARA LA FORMACION E INVESTIGACION SANITARIAS DE LA REGION DE MURCIA - FFIS DE LA REGION DE MURCIA	CENTRE NATIONAL DE LA RECHERCHE SCIENTIFIQUE CNRS - CNRS; MERCURNA BV -	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101080156/program/43108390/details	
Nanomechanical Hardware Platforms for Edge Computing	"Challenging operating environments are common across many important internet of things (IoT) applications related to enterprises and the circular economy, including automotive, aerospace, industrial and power generation. However, conventional electronics are not suitable for operation in challenging and harsh environments, e.g. at high temperatures. i-EDGE establishes an enabling nanoelectromechanical (NEM) switch technology platform for IoT edge devices operating under demanding conditions, i.e., high temperature (<300 °C) and/or high-radiation (<1 Mrad), uses zero standby power, non-volatile memory and has low compute performance requirements.
i-EDGE will realize a proof-of-concept demonstrator of a NEM “system-on-chip” (SoC) IoT node with an FPGA, non-volatile memory, and a temperature sensor, powered by a high-temperature capacitor bank, with a wireless power receiver for trickle charging the capacitor, and a simple data transceiver and sensor readout to interface to the on-chip FPGA and non-volatile memory. The FPGA fabric will be based on the NEM switch technology for digital logic, and integrated with a non-volatile memory array, analog utility blocks for wireless power transfer, data exchange and sensor readout. We will develop a NEM physical design kit (PDK) for design and circuit simulation, which will facilitate broad usage by application engineers. The technology and design flow will be demonstrated with a condition monitoring application, that has been developed for industrial IoT processes. In several previous EU and national projects, our technology has matured to TRL3 and i-EDGE will bring it to TRL5.
The i-EDGE consortium has all expertise to establish a full supply chain, from basic logic and memory cell design to Systems-on-Chip and a migration path to pilot manufacturing of the NEM technology in Europe. Thus, i-EDGE will help position the EU at the cutting edge of chip design and manufacturing capabilities, as envisaged by the EU Chips Act."

NaV1.5 regulation fine-tuning as a therapy for cardiac Conduction and Arrhythmic diseases at Risk of suddEn Death	The voltage-gated sodium channel (Na-channel; NaV1.5) is a central component of cardiac electrogenesis. Its dysfunction can lead to ventricular fibrillation and sudden cardiac death. While NaV1.5 represents a highly relevant therapeutic target for prevention of life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias, therapies that target the expression or function of this channel are non-existent. Such a therapy would provide for the first time an alternative for the invasive and costly cardioverter defibrillator or pacemaker therapies currently used. NaV1.5-CARED consortium proposes to capitalize on their largest worldwide cohorts of patients with inherited cardiac electrical and conduction defects to uncover regulatory regions and proteins that modulate NaV1.5 expression and function with the goal to develop and validate innovative therapies to restore the function of NaV1.5. We have three objectives: 1) predict the risk of (fatal) arrhythmia and conduction defect at the individual level by developing personalized polygenic risk score (PRS), 2) characterize the molecular mechanism associating regulatory DNA regions and genes with the cardiac diseases to uncover new therapeutic targets, 3) and develop new candidates for therapeutic intervention able to restore Nav1.5 loss of function. After databases harmonization, we will conduct whole genome genetic studies to identify variants associated with ventricular arrhythmia and conduction defects and generate PRS relevant to stratify the risk of arrhythmia and degree of conduction defect. Genetic studies will also be used to identify new therapeutic that will be evaluated in dedicated and high-throughput human cardiomyocytes derived induced pluripotent cell models.

NUTRIBUDGET - Optimisation of nutrient budget in agriculture.	In line with the Zero Pollution action plan and the Farm to Fork Strategy, Nutribudget will develop the prototype of a first-of-its-kind integrated nutrient management platform, called Nutriplatform, in various regions across Europe. The Nutriplatform will operate as a decision-support tool (DST) for farmers, advisors and regional authorities and before the end of the project this prototype (as a stand-alone or integrated in the existing EC promoted FaST tool for nutrient management) will be tested and used by at least 40.000 farmers across Europe. Firstly, the development of the Nutriplatform will be based on the algorithms of two advanced newly developed holistic Nutrimodels that quantify the impact of agronomic mitigation measures to optimize nutrient budget and flow across scales (from farm to Europe), across elements (C) and nutrients (N, P, K, S, Ca, Mg, Cu and Zn) and by looking at various agronomic and environmental targets. The measures will be derived from (I) existing knowledge, including input from relevant EU projects (e.g. the 4 on nutrient recycling from the call) and (II) new data from field experiments with innovative mitigation measures and combinations thereof that connect animal and crop production via agro-processing industries in 5 pilot regions (4 nutrient hotspot and 1 nutrient deficient area) in 4 different climate regions in Europe. Secondly, these measures will be linked to relevant monitoring indicators, called NutriKPIs, for agronomic performance in different farming systems, nutrient emissions and impact on biodiversity. All will be done in co-creation, according to a Nutri-actor approach, with a consortium of 17 partners from 10 countries that are all experts in their respective fields. Thereby, Nutribudget will contribute to systemically optimize nutrient management across different agricultural production systems and regions in the EU to reduce pollution due to the excessive use of nutrients and nutrient losses to the environment.

NOn-VIral gene modified STEM cell therapy	Despite the increasing awareness that cell and gene-therapy approaches have tremendous biomedical potential, their broad clinical application has been challenging due to prolonged and expensive production times and the emergence of severe immune- and gene-delivery dependent side effects. In this proposal, we aim to establish a stream-lined and high-throughput protocol for iPSC-based cell therapy by combining a novel technological platform for gene delivery with a breakthrough biological concept that will permit to manufacture functional, gene-corrected blood forming stem cells and CAR T cells. To achieve this, we will use and optimize photoporation as non-viral gene delivery method for CRISPR-mediated and site-specific gene-editing to obtain controlled CAR expression and for performing gene-correction in iPSCs. From these gene-modified iPSCs, we will generate CAR T cells and blood forming stem cells, respectively, by selectively targeting a signaling pathway that we established to be critical in human blood cell development and particularly T cell development. Following functional validation of the generated cell products, we will optimize the current protocols to increase the potential for clinical implementation and establish a high-throughput photoporation platform to generate a large number of CAR expressing iPSC lines from different ages, sex and ethnicities to demonstrate the population-wide implementation potential of our approach. This will allow to generate a bank of well-characterized, HLA-defined CAR expressing iPSC that can be used as of-the-shelf cell therapy products, thereby significantly advancing the currently implemented adaptive CAR T cell approaches by reducing the production costs and time, by selectively targeting the CAR into a well-controlled location which will prevent variability and by facilitating the production and evaluation of novel CARs for other cancer entities such as solid tumors.	iPSC; CAR T; gene therapy; HSC; non-viral	UNIVERSITEIT GENT - UGent		https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101071105/program/43108390/details

NExt-generation MOdels for advanced battery electronics	"NEMO project aims at advancing the state of the art of battery management systems (BMS) by engaging advanced physics-based and data-driven battery models and state estimation techniques. Towards achieving this goal, the consortium tends to provide efficient software and hardware to handle, host, process, and execute these approaches within high-end local processors and cloud computing.
NEMO benefits from a wide range of sensor information acquired at high frequencies in addition to dedicated electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) sensors which allow for the identification of ongoing electrochemical reactions inside each individual battery cell. Capable hardware for storing and processing such measurements will be provided by the tier1 members of this industry onboard the consortium.
The availability of such diverse physical information on batteries onboard makes room for developing cutting-edge performance, lifetime, and safety battery models and state estimators within NEMO, and validating them on two different BMS configurations. Physics-based performance model parameters continuously get updated as the battery ages, so that performance and safety state indicators maintain the least possible error. The data-driven approaches exploit mathematical algorithms to be trained upon the large datasets made available from historical or laboratory-generated battery information. Combinations of coupled physics-based and data-driven approaches are also foreseen to be implemented within NEMO as another innovation of the project to propose next-generation BMS.
Solutions offered by NEMO considerably extend battery life and make the battery system safer within long-term operation since every individual cell is monitored, controlled, and studied. NEMO’s ambitious solutions for stationary and automotive use cases are expected to be validated by industrial partners and to take a considerable share of the market in later years."

NEXT GENERATION TOOLS FOR GENOME-CENTRIC MULTIMODAL DATA INTEGRATION IN PERSONALISED CARDIOVASCULAR MEDICINE	Healthcare is the fasted growing EU27 expenditure. Personalised medicine, comprising tailored approaches for prevention, diagnosis, monitoring and treatment is essential to reduce the burden of disease and improve the quality of life. Integration of multiple data types (multimodal data) into artificial intelligence models is required for the development of accurate and personalised interventions. This is particularly true for the inclusion of genomic data, which is information-rich and individual-specific, and more routinely available as the cost of sequencing continues to fall. Multimodal data integration is complex due to privacy & governance requirements, the presence of multiple standards, distinct data formats, and underlying data complexity and volume. NextGen tools will remove barriers in data integration several cardiovascular use cases. NextGen deliverables will include tooling for multimodal data integration and research portability, extension of secure federated analytics to genomic computation, more effective federated learning over distributed infrastructures, more effective and accessible tools for genomic data analysis; improved clinical efficiency of variant prioritisation; scalable genomic data curation; and improved data discoverability and data management. A comprehensive gap analysis of the existing landscape, factoring ongoing initiatives will ensure NextGen deliverables are forward-looking and complementary. NextGen embedded governance framework and robust regulatory processes will ensure secure multi-jurisdictional multiomic multimodal data access aligned with initiatives including “1+ Million Genomes” and the European Health Data Space. Several real-world pilots will demonstrate the effectiveness of NextGen tools and will be integrated in the NextGen Pathfinder network of five collaborating clinical sites as a self-contained data ecosystem and comprehensive proof of concept.	cardiovascular medicine; genomics; federated learning; data space; data oriented architecture	UNIVERSITAIR MEDISCH CENTRUM UTRECHT - UMC UTRECHT	DATAPOWER SRL -; EURECOM GIE - EURECOM	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101136962/program/43108390/details	
NATURE-INSPIRED PROPHYLACTIC LUBRICANTS AGAINST HIV-1 AND HSV-2	Currently, there are no vaccines against HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) and HSV (herpes simplex virus) infections. Condom, when used properly, are the most effective means of prophylaxis against viral transmission. However, there is a significant gender imbalance in condom use because women are not always in control over their use. In addition, women are at least twice as likely as men to contract sexually transmitted infections (STIs) from infected partners. Several STIs, including HIV, are underdiagnosed due to asymptomatic infections and/or lack of testing facilities. This is particularly problematic for women from African countries, who are at high risk of contracting STIs but have poor access to testing facilities. Alternatives to condoms that use established antivirals for HIV prophylaxis come with issues such as antimicrobial resistance and low adherence in practice in high-risk groups. There are also no means other than condoms for prophylaxis against HSV. Co-infection with HIV/HSV results in a vicious cycle of mutual facilitation, as individuals who are carriers of HSV have a three- to fourfold increased risk of contracting HIV. Inspired by nature, NatProLub develops a radically novel prophylactic approach to HIV and HSV prophylaxis through the use of lubricants. By targeting women, who are particularly at risk, NatProLub has a clear vision for a user-friendly, prophylactic product that can redress the gender imbalance in sexual health while offering a low risk of side effects and avoiding the risk of developing antimicrobial resistance. The members of the NatProLub consortium have very strong backgrounds in relevant but complementary scientific disciplines that will contribute to the development of prophylactic lubricants for end users and have previous successful experience in managing large scientific projects, the creation of spin-off companies, and maintaining well-developed professional networks in academia, industry, and healthcare.

NANOMEDICINE FOR ORGAN TRANSPLANTATION TOLERANCE (PHOENIX)	"PROBLEM: Today, organ transplant medicine is limited by life-long immunosuppression and vulnerability to infections, malignancies and cardiovascular diseases, and by a 20% rate of long-term graft failure.

SOLUTION: PHOENIX reprograms the local immune micro-environment around a graft organ, inducing long-term transplant tolerance without broader systemic immunosuppression. 

FOUNDATIONS: Our expert teams have already discovered novel peptide-MHC complex-based nanomedicines for the treatment of autoimmune diseases. This project will transform, deploy and validate this nano-technology platform for transplant medicine. We have unique expertise in kidney and liver murine transplant models as well as liver transplantation in pigs and have established a molecular engineering pipeline for immune-protein synthesis to enable future clinical translation. Extensive clinical-trial expertise will enable us to progress efficiently from this project towards the clinic.

WORKPLAN: We are designing and building a unique nanomedicine which delivers ubiquitous or self-antigens - common to all humans – that will redirect the host immune response against the graft toward regulation and tolerance development.  These medicines will be demonstrated in murine and porcine models, laying the foundation for human clinical trials immediately post-project. 

SUMMARY: This project combines innovative multi-disciplinary approaches, building on a proven foundation, to deliver a novel therapy    which will have a transformative positive effect on organ transplant patients and healthcare."	immunology; nanotherapy; organ transplant; reprogramming the immune response	ISTITUTO DI RICERCHE FARMACOLOGICHE MARIO NEGRI - IRFMN	CENTRE HOSPITALIER UNIVERSITAIRE DE RENNES - CHU RENNES; FUNDACIO DE RECERCA CLINIC BARCELONA-INSTITUT D INVESTIGACIONS BIOMEDIQUES AUGUST PI I SUNYER - IDIBAPS-CERCA	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101076383/program/43108390/details	
Multiscale modelling for wind farm design, performance assessment and loading	The wind industry is developing wind turbines and airborne wind energy devices which span altitudes well above the well-studied surface layer. A full understanding of the unsteady inflow conditions which drive loads and performance at these altitudes is lacking. MERIDIONAL will provide a comprehensively validated tool chain based on an open-source platform which will draw on an integrated knowledge and data hub to allow the efficient and accurate assessment of the performance and loads experienced by onshore, offshore, and airborne wind energy systems. This tool chain can be used for component, device and plant level planning and operation. It will consist of models which can capture the unsteady time-resolved inflow structures which drive performance and loads within the wind plant, incorporating inter and intra farm turbine interactions. Inflow conditions will be analysed and modelled beyond the surface layer to capture the conditions within and above the atmospheric boundary layer. This is critical to a full understanding of the loads and performance of wind farms and airborne wind energy devices. Model validation will be underpinned by a range of high quality and unique datasets drawing on high-fidelity simulations, and kite-borne, lidar, drone and mast measurements from field test campaigns in complex terrain, offshore and airborne. The strength of the tool chain results from developing different models for different situations, using higher order approaches (e.g., meso and microscale LES) when required and lower order models (physics or data-driven) where these are sufficient to accurately predict loads and performance. The knowledge and data hub will allow users of the tool chain to draw on a wide range of existing and project-generated measurement and simulation data to allow site specific analysis to be carried out at any location. MERIDIONAL allows stakeholders to increase wind plant efficiency and reduce material costs through less conservative design.

Multiparametric nanoelectronic biosensors for therapy response testing	Proteases recently emerged as a promising new class of biomarkers with a broad diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic potential for different human diseases including neurological and psychiatric diseases, several types of cancer, and immune system disorders. However, there is a lack of tools for real-time activity analysis of disease-related protease biomarkers. To address this issue, we propose to develop a highly sensitive graphene-based biosensor platform for parallel detection of multiple proteases in serum. We will exploit a new label-free sensing mechanism based on charge removal due to cleavage of designer peptides by proteases. As a specific business case, we plan to address therapy response prediction along treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). MDD is one of the most common and burdensome mental disorders worldwide. MDD is also among the most expensive brain diseases in Europe. While effective treatments exist, there is a high variability in treatment response. There are no serum-based tests to predict personalized therapy for MDD patients. The effective treatment is identified through trial and error, a great burden for patients and the health care system. A rapid, sensitive and easy-to-use test would allow faster and more precise treatment identification, improving therapy outcomes and reducing hospitalization times. Here, we plan to detect two protease biomarkers associated with MDD. The biosensors will be validated in clinical serum samples. Arrays of graphene biosensors will be integrated on silicon wafers with a multiplexed readout matrix to realize a miniaturized sensor system with multi-analyte detection capability, high dynamic range, high precision, low detection limit, and low material consumption. The resulting platform technology may enable various point-of-care diagnostic and therapy prediction tools. This will help secure industrial leadership of the EU over the entire value chain of novel graphene-based bio-analytical tools.

MultiomIcs based Risk stratification of Atherosclerotic CardiovascuLar disEase	Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is the leading cause of mortality worldwide. Aside from asymptomatic manifestations, the first sign of clinically significant ASCVD is often a severe clinical event, such as stroke or myocardial infarction (MI). Thus, identifying individuals at high risk is crucial in preventing the fatal consequences of ASCVD. Current risk prediction models based on traditional risk factors, such as SCORE2, have limitations since they do not encompass all mechanisms and intermediary phenotypes leading to ASCVD. Particularly, current risk models fail to consider the disturbance of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) caused by genetic risk factors and diverse longitudinal exposures accumulating during a person's lifetime.Furthermore, the current models predict the combined risk of CAD, PAD and ischemic stroke despite mounting evidence of the heterogeneity of the underlying disease mechanisms. To capture the missing aspects of current ASCVD risk scores, MIRACLE project brings together unique data resources and expertise to provide novel multiomics based prediction models of ASCVD. We aim to (1) Integrate the globally largest CAD, PAD, and stroke GWAS information to identify genetic loci that differ between or are shared by these diseases and their subtypes, (2) Identify sex-specific subtypes of ASCVD patients using transcriptomic phenotyping of plaques and circulating biomarkers, (3) Generate functionally informed polygenic risk scores by combining experimental fine-mapping and gene prioritization approaches with integrative GRN and deep learning modelling.

Multi-material additive manufacturing for lightweight and thermal management	"The 26th Climate Change Conference has highlighted the urgent need to reduce global carbon dioxide emissions to limit global warming. The transport sector accounts for approx. 16% of the global carbon emissions and has identified fleet electrification as the primary route to achieving climate neutrality. However, the main challenges are the current weight of components and the cost of new systems to ensure efficiency and long-term sustainability. As a result, the industry has recognised the need for transformative technologies and production methods to develop lighter, more efficient, and cost-effective solutions to enable this transition and achieve climate neutrality.
With their outstanding mechanical strength, Carbon Fibre Composites (CFC) have been increasingly used to replace metals in products requiring lightweight features, such as aircraft or high-performance vehicles. However, due to the traditional manufacturing process and poor thermal conductivity, the use of CFC has been limited to structural applications. For example, batteries, electrical motors, and power electronics, where power losses need to be efficiently dissipated, typically require separate heat exchangers, resulting in heavier and less cost-effective solutions that still utilize bulky designs and heavy materials.
The vision of MULTHEM is to develop a reliable and validated Additively Manufactured (AM) CFC process with enhanced thermal conductivity with different material combinations and nanotechnology. This innovative approach will allow the development of components, such as battery and motor housings with dual functionality comprising structural and cooling features and with a more cost-effective approach than traditional methods. This solution will enhance the product performance, first by the weight reduction achieved by designs that only AM enables, and second, by using CFC-metal structures with enhanced thermal conductivity strategies, lighter and stronger than aluminium or steel."

Multi-layer 360° dYnamic orchestrion and interopeRable design environmenT for compute-continUum Systems	The “Multi-layer 360° dYnamic orchestration and interopeRable design environmenT for compute-continUum Systems (MYRTUS)” project aims to provide the technology to make CPS evolving towards a living dimension, embracing the technological principles of the TransContinuum Initiative where “edge, fog and cloud computing platforms are being pulled closer together into a seamless execution environment” and “programming has to be reinvented, with languages and tools to orchestrate collaborative distributed and decentralised components, as well as components augmented with interface contracts covering both functional and non-functional properties”. MYRTUS puts together different technologies to design and operate complex, distributed, and heterogeneous CPS computing infrastructures, leveraging diverse cloud to edge technologies, including from off the shelf CPUs to custom AI accelerators, offered by multiple providers. Main MYRTUS results are (i) the MYRTUS reference infrastructure, comprising a diversity of heterogeneous, autonomous, federated and collaborative computing nodes distributed across the computing continuum; (ii) a novel management scheme featuring MIRTO, an AI-powered cognitive engine capable of orchestrating, at 360°, the whole continuum infrastructure, and (iii) the MYRTUS design and programming environment to design, deploy, and operate such complex infrastructures. MYRTUS solutions represent the instruments to unlock the new living dimension of CPS, pursuing also sustainable and responsible computing, openness, security and trustworthiness, and promoting strategic industrial cooperations by establishing synergies with relevant initiatives and projects, as IPCEI, Gaia-X, TransContinuum Initiative. Technology assessment is carried out within two challenging scenarios, Healthcare and Mobility, involving humans.

Multi-component interventions to reducing unhealthy diets and physical inactivity among adolescents in sub-Saharan Africa	"The fragile health systems in urban sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) are already overwhelmed with NCDs. Despite this, the implementation of the evidence-based WHO Best Buys policies for NCDs prevention in the African region has been found to be off-track. Additionally, less attention has been given to adolescents and yet this is a period in life where behavioural patterns of NCDs risk factors are established and track into adulthood. There is also a gap in our understanding on how to implement and scale up effective diet and physical activity interventions in real world settings in SSA.

Our project therefore aims to reduce two important modifiable risk factors for NCDs: unhealthy diets and physical inactivity and their underlying social determinants among adolescents (aged 10-19 years) living in  mixed socio-economic urban communities in two SSA countries (Ghana & Kenya) by designing, deploying, and evaluating strategies for implementation of evidenced and theory based interventions mapped on to the WHO Best Buys. We selected the two countries because they represent different cultural contexts of nutrition transition (East and West Africa), and both countries are undergoing rapid economic development, urbanisation and increases in NCD prevalence. The intervention delivery will take a multi-sectoral approach to increasing the capability, opportunity and motivation of adolescents to eat healthier and be more physically active. We will focus on three settings to enhance the reach: secondary schools and, family/community/faith-based settings and the digital environment using social media. 

Together, this project will increase opportunities, awareness, knowledge and health literacy, motivate adolescents to increase self-efficacy, guide self-regulatory actions and adopt positive health behaviour (such as dissuasion from physical inactivity and sedentary behaviours, or unhealthy food choices) to prevent NCDs."

Multi Material Additive Manufacturing with Electrostatic Cold Spray	While additive manufacturing (AM) is deemed the future of industrial production for its exceptional freedom in design, several technical limits hinder its full exploitation. Surprisingly, the most diffused AM techniques (e.g. LPBF) are associated with almost 4 times higher energy consumption compared to conventional manufacturing processes, while being also more limited in build rate, build size, material selection and surface quality. We need to re-invent AM to tackle these challenges and expand its market to uncharted areas. In MadeCold we will achieve a real breakthrough in this direction by merging solid state and electrostatic physics, control and monitoring, and mechanical design with material science to develop a disruptive solid state deposition process. The revolutionary principle of MadeCold is to charge and accelerate metal powders to supersonic velocities in a customized electric field and take benefit from the kinetic energy to induce bonding upon impact with a substrate; this has not been done before. Relying on our preliminary results, we will implement multiscale computational models and advanced experiments to develop a single launcher to prove bonding efficiency. Then via a new control system, we will pair multiple launchers to exhibit the capacity of MadeCold for covering simultaneously a theoretically unlimited surface, compared to the point-wise print of the current AM. We will demonstrate that it outperforms the existing technologies regarding the accuracy, deposition rate, flexibility and scalability and paves the way to depositing functional multi-material structures with unprecedented properties. We intend to prove this in 3 key sectors: aerospace, energy and hybrid manufacturing with specific proofs of concept. We are confident to achieve the overall objectives via a sophisticated multi-disciplinary approach based on scientific investigations, and the exploitation of discoveries to establish Europe as a leader in advanced manufacturing.

Microbial Hydroponics: Circular Sustainable Electrobiosynthesis	For the first time, Mi-Hy brings together Microbial Fuel Cell (MFC) technology and hydroponics, thereby introducing a prosthetic rhizosphere (an extended rhizosphere community) to the typically “soil-less” configuration of hydroponics systems. The Mi-Hy system will modulate nitrogen forms, plant root microbiomes optimise nitrogen uptake, and mobilise phosphorous, averting the need for chemical fertilisers. This circular, sustainable platform turns carbon into biomass and reclaims nitrogen from wastewater streams. Linked through shared microbiomes, the bioelectricity generating Bioelectrochemical System (BES) Microbial Fuel Cell (MFC) platform is: i) optimised to generate electricity from wastewater at 1mW/1mL feedstock (setting a new benchmark for MFCs); ii)  driving wavelength-specific LEDs to optimize photosynthesis; iii) capable of recovering useful biomolecules using adjacent MFCs to modulate the  redox potential of a workhorse Microbial Electrolysis Cell (MEC) performing microbial electro synthesis (MES). This novel development brings together MFCs & MECs. Since these share common microbial constituents, they can be technologically combined without the need for external, (fossil-fuel based) energy sources. To achieve this goal, Mi-Hy aims to design biofilms using metabolic engineering in wild type symbiotic strains. This next-generation hydroponics system has near-future applications in agriculture and in the urban environment. It delivers a smart, decentralized, low power digital infrastructure with sustainable organic solutions, which are in line with the ambitions of the Missions Cities & Climate adaptation (urban agriculture, precision gardening, wastewater treatments, energy generation, synthesis of high value compounds e.g., vitamins). Mi-Hy will also invite designers and stakeholders from various sectors to co-create future applications. Ultimately, it anticipates and facilitates a healthier, sustainable, nature-based urban landscape.

Merging scientific Evidence with Regulatory practices and Leveraging identification Of endocrine disruptors using New approach methodologies	"Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) are substances that alter the function of the endocrine system and negatively affect human and animal health. In recent decades, there has been a significant increase in, for example, reproductive disorders and gender incongruence, along with a decline in fertility rates, all of which may be linked to EDC exposure. The EU has highlighted EDCs as substances of high concern and aims to minimise exposure of humans and the environment by improving regulation and policy. Yet there remain important gaps in our understanding of the impact of exposures at critical life stages and the tools for identification and ultimately regulation of EDCs.
 
The MERLON project addresses these gaps, bringing together world-leading experts in endocrinology, chemical safety assessment, developmental and molecular biology, epidemiology, toxicogenomics, toxicokinetics modelling, regulatory toxicology, psychology, psychiatry and research ethics. We will investigate EDC-mediated effects on sexual development, providing human data on the role of EDC exposure during fetal development and changes in mini-puberty, connecting to puberty, reproductive function, and gender incongruence using existing biobanks and cohorts. MERLON will apply and develop 3R-compliant New Approach Methodologies (NAMs) focusing on sexual development and function and the effects of EDCs thereon. Our cutting-edge approaches incorporate transcriptomics, pharmacokinetic models, biomarker identification and the use of Adverse Outcome Pathways, which we will utilize to develop a roadmap for EDC identification, making the best use of NAMs into the future. 

With MERLON, we will engage EU risk assessment bodies, public health authorities, regulators, scientists and researchers, healthcare providers and citizens. This will ensure all relevant stakeholders have the evidence they need to minimize EDC exposure and support effective and evidence-based regulations and policies."	reproduction; gender; endocrine disruptors; gender incongruence; NAMs; development; DOHaD; chemical regulation; AOP	DANMARKS TEKNISKE UNIVERSITET - TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY OF DENMARK DTU	FUNDACIO INSTITUT D'INVESTIGACIO SANITARIA PERE VIRGILI; HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENT ALLIANCE - HEAL	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101137411/program/43108390/details	
Medium-range hybrid low-pollution flexi-fuel/hydrogen sustainable engine	"MYTHOS proposes to develop a demonstrated innovative and disruptive design methodology for future short/medium range civil engines capable of using a wide range of liquid and gaseous fuels including SAFs and, ultimately, pure hydrogen, thus aiming at fulfilling the objective of decarbonize civil aviation as fore-seen by the ACARE SRIA short, mid and long-term Goals by 2050. To achieve these, the MYTHOS consor-tium develops and adopts a multidisciplinary multi-fidelity modelling approach for the characterization of the relevant engine components deploying the full power of the method of machine learning. The latter will lead through hidden-physics discovery to advance data-driven reduced models which will be embedded in a holistic tool for the prediction of the environmental footprint of the civil aviation of all speeds. A unique aspect of the project is the high-fidelity experimental validation of the numerical approaches. MYTHOS consortium through this approach will contribute to reduce time-to-market for engines designed and engi-neered to burn various types of environmentally friendly fuels, such as SAF, in the short and medium term, and hydrogen, in the long term.

Medical Integrated Photonic Ultrasound Transducer	"The multi-sensing 'Medical Integrated Photonic Ultrasound Transducer' (MED-IPUT) project will develop a high-resolution, high-quality, recyclable medical imaging system based on a disruptive integrated photonic ultrasound transducer concept. We envisioned a 100x increase in sensitivity compared to conventional US.

The IPUT-based sensing system, combines optical waveguides and micromechanical membranes with two optical read-out techniques (RR and MZI) to at least two US applications; medical ultrasound (US) and photoacoustics (PA). We will solve technical challenges such as increasing sensitivity, mass parallelization by optical multiplexing and hybrid integration of microelectronics in PIC, tuneable waveguides, fiber chip coupling manufacturability and packaging. These advances will lead to a higher production yield and increased insight in the processing solutions of hybrid integrated photonics. The IPUTs are based on easily accessible materials, don’t require lead to improve the performance and laser power can be reduced significantly. 

We will iteratively develop an effective SOI and SiN manufacturing process to realize very sensitive IPUT sensors and integrate them into US transducer arrays for medical imaging and PA for validation and demonstration on phantoms instead of tissue. 

The partners have the in-house capability to develop, manufacture, integrate and package the novel IPUT-based sensing systems into transducers, covering the full manufacturing value chain. 

The increase in sensitivity will enable: 
1. An increase of the US image by a factor 2.
2. An increase of the penetration depth by a factor 2.
3. A 100x reduction of the peak pressures.
4. A 100x reduction of the required laser power for PA resulting in the use of low-cost lasers.

Materials for a next-generation (nano-)opto-electro-mechanical systems	"Nano-opto-electro-mechanics (NOEMS) is an emerging field with unparalleled prospects for the design of efficient and low-power devices for ICT. However, to capitalize NOEMS potential, a flexible and up-scalable technology platform must be established, preferably based on current microelectronic technology.
MAGNIFIC aims at filling this gap focusing on nanocrystalline silicon (nc-Si), only recently used in NOEMS with very promising results, and its integration with columnar aluminium nitride. Indeed, while nc-Si is widely used in MEMS production, the dynamics of such an optically and electrically active nanocrystalline material has barely been investigated, leaving fundamental gaps in the understanding of the interplay between electrons, phoTons and phoNons.
In this context, we propose an up-scalable, cost efficient, room temperature and Si-compatible nano-opto-electro-mechanical platform for powering efficient communications technologies. The key challenge is to achieve a comprehensive understanding of the static and dynamic material properties and their interdependence. In particular, understanding the role of nano-crystallites and grain boundaries in absorption and in dissipation mechanisms at the nanoscale is crucial for energy efficiency and for reliable performance as they are intrinsically linked to losses and variability.
The aimed platform will provide a coherent interface between RF electronics and telecom-wavelength optics mediated by phoNons, able to provide different functionalities (local oscillation, frequency conversion, modulation) in highly compact, energy efficient devices.
The project starts at TRL3, achieved via two previous EC projects, and brings the system to TRL5 realizing devices and circuits, suitably packaged, and environmentally tested with RF frequencies in the 3-12 GHz range. This will allow to cover a broad variety of ICT applications including pervasive wireless networks (5G and beyond), smart cities, IoT and satellite communications."

Material and digital traceability for the certification of critical raw materials	"MaDiTraCe’s main goal is to enlarge and integrate the portfolio of technological solutions reinforcing the reliability of critical raw material (CRM) tracking and the transparency of complex supply chains. The project aims to develop and test independent digital and geo-based approaches for CRM traceability and to integrate them with a generic certification scheme for CRMs throughout mineral supply chains from the mine to the manufactured and recycled products. The project intends to increase the TRL of experimental or largely untested methods in both domains, digital and material sciences. A special attention will be payed to the complexity of mineral supply chains with points of material aggregation and of transformation (processing, refining…) including circular economy (recycling). This methodology will enable downstream industrials to prove the reliability of their sustainability claims, complying with regulation in force (notably EU Battery regulation, German Supply Chain Act) and anticipating implementation of regulation to come (EU Directive on Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence). 

MaDiTraCe’s fundament is a strong stakeholder process (WP1) with upstream and downstream industrials from mining to manufacturing industry and large networks involved via the consortia (EIT-RM) and clusters (ISMC) participating in the project. Continuous interaction with this industrial and policy-oriented stakeholder community on the traceability technology (WP2 and WP3) and the certification schemes (WP4) developed in the project will ensure to stay in line with industrial needs and expectations with respect to regulatory compliance.

The project will ensure positive impact of eXtended Reality technologies on the safety, security trustworthiness and societal aspects of the interaction between the machine, the human operator and public/non-users, and furthermore create an XR workplace that enables positive user experiences of self-efficacy and meaningfulness of work.
THEIA-XR will leverage a human-centred transdisciplinary and scenario-based co-design methodology with users, stakeholders and multidisciplinary researchers as a fully integrated project team. This methodology serves to collect human requirements and to design, develop and deploy the extended reality technologies for information presentation and interaction in the off-highway domain. The targeted extended reality technologies will enhance conventional human-machine interfaces through multi-modal information and interaction technologies, deploying innovative data visualization methods, force feedback technology and acoustic information.

MagnetoElectric and Ultrasonic Technology for Advanced BRAIN modulation	The pathological alterations of neurological function (e.g., stroke, trauma, neurodegeneration, epilepsy, neuropsychiatric diseases, chronic pain) are commonly associated with alterations in brain rhythms and activity patterns. There is an urgent clinical need for treatments that can precisely control and restore neural activity, taking advantage of state-of-the-art technological developments in a variety of fields including nanotechnology, nano- and microelectronics, novel materials, brain science, clinical neurology, and computational modelling. META-BRAIN (MagnetoElectric and Ultrasonic Technology for Advanced BRAIN modulation) brings together seven expert partners in these fields with the aim of achieving precise spatiotemporal control of brain activity using magnetoelectric nanoarchitectures that can be polarized by non-invasive, remote magnetic fields. This novel principle of brain activity control will minimize the amplitude of the required magnetic fields, be wireless, and have enhanced spatial resolution from single neurons to cortical areas. We will develop a model-driven fabrication of the coils and monitor the effects on brain function with arrays of graphene microtransistors that uniquely allow full-band recording, integrating all elements in a closed loop. As an alternative to remote brain stimulation we will also use novel ultrasonic technologies. The META-BRAIN control paradigm will be systematically studied in pre-clinical systems from individual neurons to the full brain. All developments and experiments will be carried out in conjunction with theoretical models that will simulate, quantify, and predict optimal arrangements and patterns for the desired output. Translation to humans will be evaluated with our clinical partners, and a detailed dissemination and exploitation plan will be developed by two expert company partners, one of which has extensive expertise in the fabrication of brain interface devices with a worldwide distribution capability.	cerebral cortex; neuromodulation; nanoarchitectures; magnetic stimulation; ultrasonic; CMUT; brain; neuroscience; graphene microtransistors; slow oscillations; brain activity	FUNDACIO DE RECERCA CLINIC BARCELONA-INSTITUT D INVESTIGACIONS BIOMEDIQUES AUGUST PI I SUNYER - IDIBAPS-CERCA	CONSIGLIO NAZIONALE DELLE RICERCHE - CNR; CONSORCIO CENTRO DE INVESTIGACION BIOMEDICA EN RED M.P. - CIBER	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101130650/program/43108390/details	
MODULAR MODEL-BASED DESIGN AND TESTING FOR APPLICATIONS IN SATELLITES	"The space domain, as many other engineering sectors, is actively considering novel methods and tools based on artificial intelligence, Digital Twins, virtual design and testing, and other Industry 4.0 concepts, in order to manage the increased complexity of the design of upcoming satellites. Nevertheless, especially from the satellite on-board software engineering point of view, these technologies require a solid ground to be built upon. First of all, the computational power of the hardware platform must meet the needs of the advanced algorithms running on top of it. The software layer too must both allow an efficient use of the hardware resources and at the same time guarantee non-functional properties such as dependability in compliance with ECSS standards. Finally, the design methods need to adapt to the specific challenges posed by both the increased complexity of the hardware/software layers and the Industry 4.0 concepts.
The METASAT vision is that a design methodology based on Model-Based engineering jointly with the use of open architecture hardware constitutes that solid ground. To reach its vision, METASAT will leverage existing software virtualisation layers (e.g., hypervisors), that already provide guarantees in terms of standards compliance, on top of high-performance computing platforms based on open hardware architectures. The focus of the project will be on the development of a toolchain to design software modules for this hardware/software layer. Without such measures the time and cost of developing new systems could become prohibitive as system complexity grows, reducing competitiveness, innovation, and potentially dependability across the industry.

MILD Combustion with Nitrogen and Carbon Dioxide Reforming	"Reduced net emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) are necessary to achieve the goals of limited global warming and ensure a sustainable future for our society. This proposal presents a versatile and scalable process for management and valorization of CO2 and nitrogen. Starting from biomass residues, a first step in the proposed scheme involves a pyrolysis process that results in the release pyrolysis oil of rather low heating value. However, combustion under very diluted conditions using a Moderate or Intense Low-oxygen Dilution (MILD) concept allows for efficient and low-pollutant energy conversion. The MILD combustion process is utilized for a CO2 reforming step resulting in generation of syngas. The pyrolysis and the reforming are supplied by heat from the MILD combustion that can be further supplemented by intermittent energy sources such as solar and wind power. 

The residual char product from the pyrolysis step can be upgraded by activation with CO2 and utilized for adsorption of nitrogen from biomass. The nitrogen-enriched char can then be used for soil carbonization and nitrification. The concept thus addresses the objective of CO2 and nitrogen management with efficient renewable resource deployment. It also adopts a circular approach as it can employ biomass residues as raw material and combines the production of heat and syngas with that of porous biochar materials for several possible utilizations. The process can be adapted by multiple parameters and optimized for different conditions and purposes, and rather than optimizing on a single product or aspect, the concept brings a holistic view. The development of the process will include experimental research with state-of-the-art analysis methods, based on laser diagnostics and neutron scattering, combined with numerical modeling of the thermochemical processes. Life-cycle analysis will be made during the project to guide process development and assess its impact.

MAgnetic Multiscale MOdelling Suite	Magnetic materials are essential for many applications in energy, information, and communication technologies. However, the complex phenomena at different length and time scales often limit the development of new magnetic materials and devices. The goal of this project is to develop a magnetic multiscale modeling suite that will allow the design and optimisation of magnetic materials and devices based on multiscale modelling, characterisation, and numerical optimisation. To achieve interoperability between software and analysis tools, we will establish a domain ontology for magnetic materials. We will collaborate with EU magnet industry to create standards for linking simulation software for magnetic materials from first principles simulations and micromagnetics to device level simulators. MaMMoS will use artificial intelligence (AI) to fuse modeling and characterization data. AI methods will identify and correct systematic errors in the simulation data, enabling more accurate predictions. Moreover, AI models can fill gaps where measurements are not available. AI models can also serve as a surrogate in multi-objective optimisation. Optimisation will guide further experiments or simulations, reducing the development time. In MaMMoS, we will apply this approach to speed up the development of permanent magnets with reduced critical elements for electric machines and to optimise the layout of magnetic field sensors for high linearity range. The MaMMoS software will be validated against benchmarks defined according to the industrial requirements for electric machine and sensor design. The multiscale magnetic materials modeling suite will be made open source to enable easy access to high-end simulation tools.

Low and very-low-field 3D magnetic resonance spirometry for advanced regional exploration of respiratory diseases	"Lung function is a central concern in the fight against covid-19. Beyond the pandemic heavy losses and long-term health implications, respiratory diseases represent a major threat for the World Health Organisation. It is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, associated to our way of living and impacting all of society. Current tools for diagnosing and monitoring pulmonary conditions are hindered by poor sensitivity (lung function tests), radiation exposure (computed tomography) or examination cost (magnetic resonance imaging, MRI). They all differently fail to fully assess lung structure and function
V|LF-Spiro3D aims at democratizing newly developed and breakthrough 3D MR spirometry with high performance, low-cost MRI techniques to provide a ten-minute morphofunctional MRI protocol to engage patients in a safer, easier and more comfortable way.
Based on recent works at Universities Paris-Saclay and Aberdeen, in collaboration with leading MR manufacturer Siemens, SME NMR Service, major French-Dutch hospitals and patient organisations, V|LF-Spiro3D brings together multidisciplinary experts in a patient-oriented approach for both adults and children
V|LF-Spiro3D will redesign current MRI architecture to perform 3D MR spirometry at low and very low field. High-performance MRI hardware will be developed with accelerated acquisitions and coupled reconstruction strategies relying on deep learning. Biomechanical lung modelling and deep data processing will be guided by implementation of 3D MR spirometry in clinical facilities to produce unprecedentedly large sets of normative and training data covering six major respiratory diseases
By prioritizing both technology transfer and innovation, V|LF-Spiro3D aims to build up a one-stop-shop imaging standard for unrestricted assessment of lung pathophysiology. The impacts are expected to yield benefits beyond lung imaging and boost health deep-tech on point-of-care imaging and multi-parameter-based digital health in the EU"	Lung Diseases Asthma Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia Cystic Fibrosis Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Bronchiolitis Disease Obliterans Syndrome Biomechanics Modelling Low-field MRI 3D Pulmonary Function Test	UNIVERSITE PARIS-SACLAY -	ASSISTANCE PUBLIQUE HOPITAUX DE PARIS -; ASSOCIATION HOPITAL FOCH -	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101099934/program/43108390/details	
Living Therapeutic and Regenerative Materials with Specialised Advanced Layers	"Skin is a living interface with layers of specialised functions (sensing, regeneration, protection). The level of complexity in skins is currently unreached in engineered living materials (ELMs). Here we will create skin-inspired ELMs with layers with living cells, specialised properties and functions. Our living skins are based on a grown matrix hosting engineered multicellular consortia that build and functionalise different layers. Spatiotemporal patterning is realised by genetic control and the physicochemical properties of cells and biomolecules. Our aim is to generate platform technologies to advance biological ELMs and make two proof-of-concept engineered living skins with different applications:

We will fabricate a self-encapsulated Living Therapeutic Skin (LTS) made of a bacterial cellulose hydrogel matrix with sense-and-respond cells. LTS will have an interactive layer with sensing functions, a core layer for responsive living cells, and a barrier layer for biocontainment and hydration. An example LTS will be designed to sense pathogenic skin bacteria in eczema and release biosynthesised therapeutic molecules.

A dry and tough Living Regenerative Skin (LRS) consisting of biomineralized biopolymers hosting bacterial spores will be fabricated as an alternative to traditional inert materials (ceramics, plastics) in protective garments. The LRS biomineralized core will arrange in microscale layers, like tough biominerals in nature (nacre, bone, dentin). LRS will be encapsulated in an activator shell, engineered to prevent water penetration and to memorize local mechanical experience, giving local self-reinforcement of mechanically stressed regions, a unique property compared to current materials and other ELMs.

As a powerful strategy to accelerate the adoption of our living materials in society, we will systematically involve the potential end-users and designers in our research for the materials and product development to happen in synergy."	engineered living materials; adaptive materials; genetic engineering; protein materials; bacterial cellulose; composite; self-assembly; encapsulation; biomineralization; material-driven design	TECHNISCHE UNIVERSITEIT DELFT - TU Delft	AALTO KORKEAKOULUSAATIO SR - AALTO	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101071159/program/43108390/details	
Limiting West Nile Virus impact by novel vaccines and therapeutics approaches	"West Nile virus (WNV) is considered one of the most widespread mosquito-borne viral disease in the world. While most of WNV infected individuals are asymptomatic, 1% of WNV-infected individuals develop a severe illness that affects the central nervous system, causing encephalitis or meningitis and eventually the death. The case-fatality rate notoriously increases in immunosuppressed individuals and in population over 60 years old (up to 30%) and, to date, there is no prophylaxis or treatment for this disease. Here, we aim to develop a safety prophylactic WNV vaccine that cover WNV diversity and protect elderly individuals by promoting the generation of potent and long-lasting neutralizing humoral and T cell responses, with limited or no cross-reactive activity against other flaviviruses. If success, the present proposal may guide the development of effective vaccines against other viruses, particularly flaviviruses. 
Methods: We will use outstanding computational tools to design novel Envelope-based immunogens that cover the global WNV genetic variability. Immunogens will be designed for eliciting highly-specific neutralizing humoral responses, with limited potential to mediate antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection or disease. In addition, we will also seek for T cell responses that work synergistically with antibodies to generate a long-lasting and polyfunctional protective anti-WNV immune response. Besides a classical and highly effective recombinant protein-based vaccine approach, we will explore novel and innovative strategies based on Virus Like Particles, and the use of antibodies as adjuvants, that may improve vaccine immunogenicity and efficacy. For immunogenicity analysis we have designed a complete set of assays that encompasses from in vitro testing, using human immune cells (tonsil and PBMCs) to in vivo evaluation using both young and old mice, and a complementary swine model.

LightCure - Light for double specificity and efficacy without burden	Congenital hyperinsulinism (CHI) is a group of rare diseases of newborns and infants with functionally defective nonneoplastic beta-cells that cause hypoglycemia and severe morbidity through oversecretion of insulin. CHI is a major cause of hypoglycemic brain injury with intellectual disability, epilepsy and cerebral palsy. As no registered causal therapy exists, management of CHI aims at increasing blood glucose levels causing severe side effects in all patients while life-threatening frequent hypoglycaemias remain. Removal of hyperfunctioning beta cells by pancreatectomy leads to insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) and maldigestion of food, changing one disease for another with severe secondary morbidity. Management of CHI is choosing between evils and symptomatic management is partially effective in only some sub-types. CHI also represents a major burden for families, because of disability but also as a result of continuous monitoring and correction of glucose levels for many years, requiring permanent alertness. Health problems and economic decline occur in most parents. A normal life is not feasible for families with babies with CHI. LightCure consortium partners have demonstrated the feasibility of selectively targeting beta cells using exendin 4 (EX) labelled with a photosensitizer (700DX) specifically binding to beta cells. This photosensitizer can be activated by light of a certain wavelength and will produce radical oxygen species leading to cell damage, a principle called targeted photodynamic therapy (tPDT). In this project we will build on existing cutting-edge technology exclusively available to the consortium partners and perform human proof of concept studies demonstrating safety and efficacy of tPDT with EX700DX. We will deliver the proof-of-concept that after injection of EX700DX, minimally invasive tPDT leads to normalization of blood glucose levels avoiding morbidity, enabling a normal life for babies with CHI and their families.

Lead-free Transition for the European Space Sector	"Due to the overall transition of the Electronics industry worldwide to a Pb-free realm, the Space Industry is more and more confronted with a situation where they cannot avoid using EEE (Electrical, Electronic and Electromechanical) parts with Lead-free finishes and they need to manage the associated risks. The growing use of commercial components (COTS), notably for the expanding market sector of constellations, means that European Space Industry is already using large amount of components with lead-free finishes even when the equivalent leaded high-reliable version is available. Even though the Space Sector is exempted from RoHS restrictions (Restriction on the use of certain Hazardous Substances), market pressure may also result on potential future difficult availability of leaded solder paste. 

This project addresses the main challenges of the Pb-free transition for the European Space Sector that were described in the Roadmap delivered in 2020 by the ESCC Task Force created to that end. First, we will study the obstacles that hinder today the wider use of COTS components in space projects using existing qualified assembly processes based on leaded solders. Second, we will launch a comprehensive evaluation of two lead-free solders that show promise for the Space Sector including reliability model development. 

Sn-solders were alloyed with lead at the beginning of the electronics era mainly to inhibit the growth of whiskers, therefore going to lead-free electronics creates a serious risk for space projects that may result in catastrophic failure in the satellite due to whiskers growth. The Space sector has developed mitigation approaches but the real challenge is to obtain accelerated tests that will give confidence that, for a given mitigation used and for the duration of the project, the risk is managed and acceptable. For that we propose to perform basic research to advance the state-of-the-art on our knowledge of whisker growth, leading to the determinat"		SCALIAN OP - SCALIAN OP	AIRBUS DEFENCE AND SPACE SAS -; ALTER TECHNOLOGY TUV NORD SA - TECNOLOGICA	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101135428/program/43108390/details	
Just transition to a green and digital future for all	"The policies driving the green and digital transitions, or twin transitions, are intended to level the field to achieve the European Growth Model and attain the EU Green Deal and the UN’s SDGs. However, these policies have had unintended and unforeseen effects, creating new inequalities and/or aggravating existing ones. Those primarily affected are social groups already at risk and EU’s most vulnerable regions. Public authorities and policy-makers at local, national and European levels therefore need evidence-based understanding of these inequalities and concrete ways to prevent and/or mitigate these. 
The READJUST project aims to suggest policy options for overcoming these (potential) trade-offs between efficiency and equality in twin transitions, in the key sectors of mobility and agri-food. The green and digital policies are intended to level the field for attaining SDGs; however, they may return uneven distribution of access to the transitions and their benefits. READJUST aims to suggest options for overcoming the perceived trade-off between efficiency and equality in policy and to make inclusive growth a reality. Policymakers portray a future that is green and digital for the EU, and they aim to continuously contain the unintended consequences of the green and digital transitions in terms of inequalities. Generating zero negative effects on the climate can be efficiently achievable by twining green and digital transitions. Nonetheless, individually and jointly, the transitions might widen the existing inequality gaps. This project aims to contribute to policies for fair and just twin transitions to mitigate existing inequalities driven by the twin transitions and minimize the transitions’ unintended consequences for equality. In this project, we strive to address the inequalities created or exacerbated by the twin transitions policies in certain domains.

JOSEPHSON GATED TRANSISTORS AND ELECTRONICS	"Improving the energy efficiency of densely-integrated electronic is an important goal towards the sustainability of modern digitally-connected society, in particular for what concerns high-performance computing datacenters. An important piece of the solution is found in the contacts between metallic leads and the semiconducting channels that constitute the core of transistors, the key active component in integrated circuits. A significant part of increasing the energy efficiency is tied to managing the resistance that appears between metals and semiconductors: the contact resistance. 
In JOGATE we utilise the unique superconducting properties in hybrid superconductor-semiconductor components to uncover the mechanisms contributing to the contact resistance and thereby improve it. In doing so, not only we contribute to solving a major obstacle for the energy efficiency of established digital electronics, but we obtain the superconducting analogues to the conventional transistors and diodes. These superconducting components are unique in that they enable new avenues for superconducting circuit design, resulting in opportunities in miniaturisation, performance and cost of devices that find application in communication, sensing and detection, signal amplification and routing.
In JOGATE we wish to study superconducting transistors and diodes and to upgrade their fabrication processes to be compatible with the methods of large-scale integration, making it possible for Europe to lead their industrial production. In parallel, we contribute to finding ways of improving their performance, to ease practical adoption and impact in areas ranging from cryogenic electronics to demanding environments such as space applications. Finally, to demonstrate the value of the technology and to deliver important outcomes in the short-term, we develop two prototype devices for cryogenic microwave signal management: a radiofrequency switch and an integrated superconducting qubit control chip."	contact resistance; Josephson field effect transistor; superconducting diode; energy efficiency	TEKNOLOGIAN TUTKIMUSKESKUS VTT OY - VTT	CHALMERS TEKNISKA HOGSKOLA AB -; COMMISSARIAT A L ENERGIE ATOMIQUE ET AUX ENERGIES ALTERNATIVES - CEA; JYVASKYLAN YLIOPISTO - UNIVERSITY OFJYVASKYLAN	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101135240/program/43108390/details	
Ionic Propulsion in Atmosphere	"This project aims to bring ionic air-breathing propulsive systems beyond the pioneeristic phase, exploring their capabilities and improving their performance. Non-thermal plasma for atmospheric propulsion is a subject of recent investigations: model airplanes and vertical lifters have recently flown with this type of propulsion, but the potential of this technology is much higher. Many open aspects in this field deserve to be investigated, from fundamental research on ion production to geometric optimization of electrodes and integration of propulsion systems in existing aircraft. 

To this purpose, a complete research program is proposed, starting from breakthroughs in fundamental research to be achieved through theoretical, numerical and  laboratory studies. The following steps will lead to develop improved and optimized propulsive units, with the objective of designing and building an airship model (technological demonstrator) with ionic propulsion. A further objective is the conceptual design of a full-scale stratospheric airship: for this aircraft the high risk approach of the project will give rise to different possible choices about propulsion, depending on the results achieved in the first steps. In particular, for this airship concept at least fully ionic propulsion and combined conventional/ionic propulsion will be considered.

A major long-term impact is expected for ion-powered airships, which could act as stratospheric platforms replacing many satellite functions, such as telecommunications, remote sensing, disaster risk management in civil protection, offering these services at much lower costs, with the benefit of being recoverable systems. A fully successful program may lead to top-level, fully ion-powered airships: thanks to the propulsive units without moving mechanical parts, powered by solar energy, they would have extremely long operation times, low maintenance and very low pollution levels."	electrohydrodynamics (EHD); electroaerodynamics; ionized gas; ionic wind; corona discharge; EHD thruster; ionic propulsion; ionic air-breathing propulsion; ion-powered airship; stratospheric airship	POLITECNICO DI MILANO - POLIMI	AERONORD DI ENZO CISARO & C.

Investigation of endocrine-disrupting chemicals as contributors to progression of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease	MASLD is the condition of excessive accumulation of liver fat unrelated to alcohol intake, ranging from simple steatosis to metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH). With a 25% prevalence in the general population, MASLD is currently the most common liver disease, and a major healthcare and economic burden. While hyperlipidaemia, obesity and insulin resistance are the major risk factors for MASLD and contribute to its rising prevalence, growing evidence suggests that exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) can initiate and/or cause progression of MASLD. EDC-MASLD will focus on investigating the impact of environmental exposure to EDCs on the internal exposome (metabolome, gut microbiome, epigenome, proteome, immunome) and degree of liver damage in MASLD in prospective study settings, with a focus on the period of transition to progressive stages of MASLD. EDC-MASLD is particularly focused on interactions between EDC exposure, sex, genotype, diet, socioeconomic and lifestyle factors, via the data and biosamples available in the unique European NAFLD Registry, comprising over 9,000 patients with histologically characterised MASLD. EDC exposure studies will be performed in murine models of MASLD, zebrafish models, and human 2D/3D in vitro models, with an aim to understand respective mechanisms-of-action and to develop novel EDC screening tools. The EDC-MASLD consortium has diverse and complementary expertise in the domains of hepatology, endocrinology, toxicology, exposome research, metabolomics, systems biology, environmental economics, and communications & technology research, with respective PIs being global leaders in their fields. Taken together, EDC-MASLD will significantly contribute to the actions centred on identification and mechanistic assessment of impact of EDCs, strategies to monitor and reduce exposure, and regulatory actions that could better protect human and environmental health.

Intracranial Neuro Telemetry to Restore Communication	Not being able to communicate while still being conscious is a horrifying prospective for many patients worldwide. Patients with motor neuron disorders, trauma or stroke risk losing complete muscle control leading to Locked-In Syndrome (LIS) which leaves them completely paralysed and unable to communicate. This is an intolerable, fearful situation with very low quality of life and extreme burden of care for patients, family, and care givers. Intracranial Neuro Telemetry to REstore COMmunication (INTRECOM) will provide a breakthrough for these patients by developing a novel, fully implantable Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) technology that allows for real-time speech decoding and use in the home environment. This BCI system will significantly transcend current technology by providing a high-resolution and sustainable device, combining state-of-the-art hardware and software solutions based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) to liberate LIS patients from their isolation.

Intracellular Carrier Against Resistant microOrganisms (ICARO)	Intracellular pathogens and viruses elicit immune responses by presenting their antigens to T cells. At the same time, they have evolved immune evasion mechanisms which essentially reduce the antigenic repertoire that is presented to the immune system. To overcome this problem, the EIC-funded ICARO project proposes to use silicon-based microchips that carry pathogen antigens and can be internalised by immune cells to aid antigen presentation. These biochips are retained within cells for a long time and will provide the foundation for a novel vaccination strategy that can boost specific and long-lasting T cell responses.

Intelligent design of adenovirus vectors (iAds)	"Advanced therapies, and in particular gene therapies, hold great potential for treating diseases for which few options exist. Efficient gene transfer is inherently and intransigently linked to vector efficacy. Partially due to the lack of suitable delivery systems for particular applications, the success of too many gene therapies is limited. 

Over the last two decades, immense progress has been made in the development of viral vectors. Importantly, this progress has also identified vector characteristics and biological factors that decrease efficacy. While limited efficacy is relevant for all vector platforms, it is more pressing in the case of adenoviruses because they have so much potential. In some cases, host responses and imperfect targeting have stunted adenovirus vector development for therapies that require long-term transgene expression.

Our multi-faceted consortium proposes an innovative approach to overcome these limitations and to construct a pathway for developing improved vectors for clinical gene transfer. By synergising French, Dutch, British, Spanish and Swedish expertise in structural biology, receptor engagement, neurobiology, cardiobiology, and bioprocessing, we will create in silico designed intelligent adenovirus vectors (iAds). Our disruptive concept abandons the classical approach of developing vectors from naturally occurring adenoviruses. Instead, a proprietorial adenovirus type will be serially stripped of unwanted elements to create a bank of iAds, which will then be engineered for heart- and brain-specific targeting. Our consortium blends academic ingenuity and SME/pharma manufacturing that will allow seamless clinical translation. With the support of the EIC Programme, our ground-breaking approach should revolutionise gene transfer and generate solutions in areas of unmet medical need via a platform that exploits the full potential of viral vectors."

Intelligent Robotic Endoscopes for Improved Healthcare Services	"In Intelligent Robotic Endoscopes (IRE) for Improved Healthcare Services we envision creating intelligent robotics solutions, extending current endoscope technology with robotics control that is based on learning from currently collected human operator data, coupled with novel bio-mechanical modeling techniques, and sensory feedback as well as soft robotics phantom for training.

The challenge with colonoscopy is that the success rate of detecting cancer depends on the skills of the clinician that operates the endoscope. From a health and societal perspective, the number of colonoscopies is bound to increase as they are the only way to screen patients for early cancer detection. Many European countries have national screening programs. This is a very big market in need of improved technology.

IRE enables a new generation of intelligent robots that through data, simulation and learning can interact with the interior of a living human while communicating with a human operator. The huge variation of human anatomy and the dynamic effect of human physiology make it a complicated navigational task to use endoscopes. Entanglement, haemorrhage, and perforation risks create a critical and difficult environment to navigate autonomously in where even trained human operators meet challenges. We exploit one of the largest datasets on real-life colonoscopies with more than 2,000 operations to learn safe navigation, combined with simulated training on a population of biomechanical models of the abdominal region.

IRE boosts the design and configuration of the robotic endoscope using digital twins and simulation, and careful inclusion of clinicians will speed up the process of integration. IRE will raise the level of autonomy by building upon simulation, imaging, and learning to yield an increased interpretation and understanding of the complex real- world environments, capable of anticipating the effect of human motions, adapting and replanning to avoid entanglement."

Integrating Adaptive Learning in Maritime Simulator-Based Education and Training with Intelligent Learning System	While all educational sectors have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, the vocational-oriented academic training components in higher education sectors have been more severely affected than others. For undergraduate and graduate students currently studying for a career at sea, the pandemic has led to suspension to their simulator training sessions, vocational learning opportunities and future careers. The simulator-based education and training domain, which forms the platform of skilled manpower supply for the maritime industry, is facing this unprecedented challenge to ensure the continuity of the educational activities and to cope with the constraints imposed by the pandemic. High-quality vocational education is the cornerstone of effective youth transitions into the labour market for the European society. The suspension of simulator-based training and tutoring sessions has led to concerns regarding whether the higher and vocational educational institutes can produce a sufficient and competent workforce who could adequately carry out on-board navigation functions safely and efficiently in the near future. By accounting for the needs, knowledge gaps and challenges faced by today’s maritime education and training sector, the i-MASTER project aims to integrate emerging technologies in vocational education and training to develop an innovative Intelligent Learning System (ILS) with maritime learning analytics and adaptive learning function to facilitate both remote and on-site maritime simulator-based education and training. The i-MASTER solution will significantly enhance the effectiveness and accessibility of simulator-based education in the European society and further improve safety, security and performance of maritime operations of the future.

Integrated blue light phased arrays enabling underwater optical wireless networks: towards a new era of Internet of Underwater Things (IoUT)	The Internet of Underwater Things (IoUT) is defined as a worldwide network of smart interconnected underwater objects, poised to revolutionize a number of related technologies including ocean monitoring observatories, underwater exploration and resource exploitation, disaster prediction and prevention, aquaculture, and defense/security. The establishment of the IoUT requires sensing, localization, and data transmission functionalities, which are mostly achieved through the use of underwater wireless sensor networks, consisting of small, intelligent, and battery-powered sensors. A crucial point is to enable transmission of the collected data over relatively large distances with high speed, low power consumption and low environmental impact. Underwater optical wireless communication (UOWC) represents a promising technology with the potential of addressing these requirements. However, the current UOWC technology suffers from several drawbacks, mainly related to the beam misalignment and low localization accuracy underwater, making it unviable to reach the requirements of establishing the IoUT. BlueArray will explore breakthrough technologies for the next generation of UOWC systems with the ambition of making unprecedented underwater data connectivity, with requirements in terms of range, energy efficiency, node mobility, as well as low environmental impact. To face the numerous related challenges, BlueArray will undertake a radically new approach by enabling efficient and high-speed optical beam steering, featuring low loss, narrow beam, and large field-of-view. This is accomplished through advancing blue VCSELs, blue optical phased arrays (OPAs), large-scale array of digital-to-analog converters, and coherent receiver technologies with a complexity going well beyond the state-of-the-art. By developing such an integrated blue OPA-based UOWC technology, BlueArray will enable cost-effective, robust, and scalable UOWC systems allowing the deployment of large-scale IoUT.	underwater optical wireless communications; optical phased array; blue VCSEL; Internet of underwater things; optical communications	DANMARKS TEKNISKE UNIVERSITET - TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY OF DENMARK DTU	CHALMERS TEKNISKA HOGSKOLA AB -; ECOLE CENTRALE DE MARSEILLE EGIM -	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101130710/program/43108390/details	
Integrated COnversion of NItrate and Carbonate streams	ICONIC (Integrated COnversion of Nitrate and Carbonate streams) pursues the development of a new technology to remediate water ecosystems that have been polluted due to intense agriculture, farming, and CO2 emissions, using electrolysis, to generate globally used chemicals. In particular, ICONIC seeks to convert damaging species responsible of eutrophication and ocean acidification (namely nitrates and carbonates from seawater) into urea, the most important globally produced C-N chemical. Powered by renewables, this offers a path to closing the carbon and nitrogen cycles. ICONIC proposes an integrated electrochemical approach demonstrating, for the first time, the co-electrolysis of carbonates and nitrates into urea selectively, and industrial relevant currents, from seawater using scalable prototypes. Our innovation stems on the accelerated discovery of new catalysts that, based on non-critical raw materials, activate and couple C and N species; their bottom-up synthesis and assembly into mesostructured electrodes to program reaction environments at high current densities; and their implementation into membrane electrode assemblies, all informed by operando characterizations that inform predictive models to guide in the rational design of the catalyst and system. ICONIC leverages interdisciplinary expertise in the areas of chemistry, electrochemistry, materials science, spectroscopies, and engineering, spanning all scales from catalyst design to system-level implementation. ICONIC’s findings would also have positive impact on water-based electrolysis with great decarbonization potential, contributing to their potential operation using abundant seawater.

Integrated 4D driver modelling under uncertainty	The vision of i4Driving is to lay the foundation for a new industry-standard methodology to establish a credible and realistic human road safety baseline for virtual assessment of CCAM systems. The two central ideas we propose are (1) a multi-level, modular and extendable simulation library that combines existing and new models for human driving behavior; in combination with (2) an innovative cross-disciplinary methodology to account for the huge uncertainty in both human behaviors and use case circumstances. This rigorous treatment of the uncertainty is crucial to assess how much of our confidence in model inputs, parameters, and structure is justified. It also makes explicit how experts from different disciplines judge the outcomes and how justified the underlying assumptions really are. Our consortium combines all the expertise needed to develop this methodology (e.g., traffic engineering, human factors, data & computer science). We have the experimental means to gather the evidence beyond the state-of-art needed to realistically simulate (near) accidents in multi-driver scenarios (access to many data sources, advanced driving simulators, and field labs). We have a strong international network to collaborate with and harmonize our approach with academic and professional partners in e.g., the US (NADS facility); Australia (UQ advanced driving simulator and TRACSLab connected driving simulator facilities), China (Tongji Univ. 8-dof driving simulator and large-scale field lab) and Japan (NTSEL). Finally, we have all the relevant partners on-board to test and apply the methodology (Universities and research labs, OEMs and Tier 1, vehicle regulators, type-approval authorities, standardization institutes, insurance companies). i4Driving offers a proposition for the short and the longer term: a set of building blocks that pave the way for a driving license for AVs.	human factors; uncertainty; driving simulator;	PANTEIA BV -	AIMSUN SL - AIMSUN SL; CONSIGLIO NAZIONALE DELLE RICERCHE - CNR	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101076165/program/43108390/details	
Innovative methodology to prevent and mitigate diffuse pollution from urban water runoff	"WATERUN project aims to develop an innovative methodology to contribute to the implementation of urban water runoff management plans in cities based on the Water-Sensitive Urban Design concept. This methodology will provide preventive and mitigation solutions and best management practices adopting a holistic perspective (from source identification to remediation strategies) for diffuse water pollution control in urban catchments. The target is to transform the urban water runoff management by the development of identification, planning and risk-based tools and new working procedures (guidance), counting on the early involvement of the main urban water management and governance actors (co-creation process) to ensure a wider and faster adoption.

Three case studies (city of Santiago de Compostela, city of Aarhus and city of Amman) have been chosen to obtain data and to elaborate, perform and validate the proposed WATERUN methodology. These case studies have been selected according to different climate conditions, land use and level of implementation of measures for diffuse pollution, in order to validate the tools in different scenarios. Key stakeholders as RTO, industry, public authorities, urban planners and citizens will participate in a continuous co-creation process from a multi-disciplinary approach ensuring that decisions for urban water runoff management are made with complete comprehension of environmental, social and economic dimensions.

In addition to providing solutions for sustainable urban water management, the WATERUN methodology will allow to gain advanced knowledge on diffuse water pollution in cities in a climate change context, thus contributing to protect water bodies and the environment, and ensuring high water quality for all.

Innovative cultivation methods for marine biodiscovery	Despite their well-recognized potential, marine bioactive molecules are still difficult to source due to a lack of controlled culturing and processing infrastructures, and their chemical synthesis is hampered by their chemical complexity. The marine environment is largely affected by global change and wild harvesting of marine bioresources does not represent a sustainable supply of these biomolecules. The main sources of the high-value biomolecules are corals, sponges, algae, involving industrial end-users in the medical and pharmaceutical, food, and cosmetic sectors. Therefore, new approaches are urgently needed in marine biotechnology as microbial engineering has not fully met the expectations for producing the marine bioactives identified in invertebrates and seaweeds. Recent advances in thesynthetic biology of terrestrial natural products are offering unique opportunities to supply bioactives of terrestrial origin.  Omics technologies have also transformed the way the complexity of the marine holobiont can be viewed and today the integration of omics data such as genomics and metabolomics can increase our understanding of the functioning and processes of living organisms including their metabolic pathways. COMBO will allow the transfer of knowledge from terrestrial to marine biotechnology through the engineering of marine metabolic pathways using Omics approaches. The rationale behind COMBO lies in the power of synthetic consortia of host cells and microbial cells based on the concept of holobiont and auxotrophy.  To this end, we will exploit the recent advances in co-cultures systems.  Indeed, the development of synthetic consortia has been shown to support specific ecological dynamics,  promote microbial species growth,  and syntheses of valuable chemicals.  COMBO will therefore expand the potential offered by underused marine sponges and seaweeds known to produce bioactives such as terpenoids and alkaloids for the cosmetic and pharmaceutical markets.

Innovative and Inclusive Democratic Spaces for Deliberation and Participation	Deliberative and participatory processes currently lack full legitimacy due to the exclusion and marginalisation of several vulnerable communities from democratic spaces.  iDEM will address this issue in the context of marginalisation and exclusion of people who need support to fully be able to read, write and comprehend language (around six million individuals in the EU and over 90 million people globally). iDEM will lay the theoretical foundations for the analysis of current marginalisation  from deliberative processes  of diverse under-represented groups due to language skills and propose, implement, and evaluate inclusive deliberative and participatory spaces. It will adopt a user-centred approach for making participatory processes more accessible and inclusive, developing advanced natural language processing technologies and artificial intelligence to empower under-represented groups with tools to facilitate communication and dialog in democratic spaces.  iDEM  will co-create the next-generation multilingual models  aimed at (1) detecting possible sources of problems in understanding messages and biases for several European languages and audiences, (2) automatically adapting texts in those languages to be accessible and unbiased for these audiences, (3) providing AI tools for enhancing the controllable generation of messages and discourses.  iDEM will innovate democratic spaces with customised, user-centric technology enhancing the participation and representation of marginalised groups by providing unbiased and inclusive technology.  To do so,  iDEM  will also build on the results of relevant past  projects, and seek collaboration with related projects and  relevant centres for democracy in Europe.

Innovations for vaccines against helminth infections	"Infections with parasitic worms (helminths) continue to cause a massive global health burden. Yet, effective vaccines to enable control and elimination of helminth infections do not exist. Primary reasons for this are that target discovery approaches are not well-developed, protective immune mechanisms are only partially clarified at best, production platforms tailored to specific helminth vaccine requirements are not available, and a pipeline for selecting and rapidly progressing pre-clinical and clinical vaccine candidates is generally lacking. Moreover, controlled human infection models are only now being developed and optimized for some of the most important human helminths. These models have not yet been widely implemented in vaccine development programs to date.

The objective of WORMVACS2.0 is to establish an effective pipeline to support helminth vaccine development focusing on schistosomes and hookworms, and ultimately the control and elimination of some of the world’s most devastating and persistent Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs). We aim to achieve this through the development and application of an innovative approach leveraging controlled human infection models, novel platforms for helminth vaccine/vaccine antigen production, experimental animal models, and improved target discovery methodology applying state-of-the-art immunological profiling to identify correlates and signatures of protection. 

WORMVACS2.0 will advance scientific and clinical knowledge of host immunity in response to helminth infection, apply innovative and sustainable platform technologies tailored to the next generation of effective vaccines against helminth infections of global importance. The project will produce a diversified portfolio of hookworm and schistosome vaccine candidates ready for progressing to clinical testing and conduct a phase 1 clinical trial to advance an mRNA platform based schistosomiasis vaccine."

In-vessel implantable smart sensing device for personalised medicine	"The IV-Lab project aims at designing and manufacturing a miniaturized sensing device implantable in the blood vessel for monitoring the health status of patients. The micro-sensor-system would implement a body-embedded system with multiple sensing capabilities, targeting hemodynamic and biochemical parameters, once implanted into blood vessels (vein and/or arterial blood vessels) of vulnerable patients with cardiovascular diseases. The final goal of the proposal aims at responding the main requests from the Pathfinder Heath work program, that is to endow people with unperceivable  sensors, which will allow 1. the continuous long-term monitoring of the health status, and 2. the diagnosis and personalized medical intervention.
Once in the vessel, the sensor will be completely unobtrusive and capable of continuous monitoring. The implanted system will be connected with (and powered by) external data collection and communication system coupled trough standardized wireless technology (i.e. NFC), or even simply by a smartphone in case of asynchronous on-demand monitoring. The device will have miniaturized and shape size allowing the placemen inside veins and arteries without impairing the blood flow, and will be provided with multiple different sensors, able to work in a continuous or asynchronous way, depending on the specific use cases. 
This device will find important applications in the field of cardiovascular disease, in particular in those patients in which the detection of hemodynamic behavior and specific biomarkers could reduce the re-hospitalization and mortality (i.e. heart failure). 
Moreover, in perspective, the system will make possible to monitor the development and outcome of different disease, allowing a prompt and tailored treatment."

Improving understanding of lung immunity in tuberculosis to establish a diverse, innovative TB vaccine pipeline targeting mucosal immunity	"Tuberculosis (TB) remains one of the most devastating infectious diseases worldwide, killing over 4,000 people every day. Prevention of tuberculosis infection by novel vaccines would provide the most cost-effective approach to achieve the goals of the WHO End TB strategy and the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations.
While there are few promising TB vaccine candidates available, innovation by new platforms and strategies is needed to ensure that the most effective and affordable vaccines are developed. 
TBVACHORIZON will innovate and diversify the global TB vaccine pipeline by pursuing four objectives:
1. Define the composition, spatial organisation and functioning of protective immune responses in the Mycobacterium tuberculosis-infected lung.
2. Evaluate whether mucosal re-vaccination with BCG and other live attenuated vaccines improves protective efficacy against tuberculosis infection in mice, non-human primates and humans.
3. Identify host immune response profiles and biomarkers of natural and vaccine-induced immune protection in the lung.
4. Support next generation TB vaccine development by standardised head-to-head testing of selected vaccine candidates in animals and the establishment of novel delivery systems, adjuvant formulations and GMP platforms for live attenuated vaccines.
TBVACHORIZON will increase our understanding and develop tools pertaining to immune protection in the lung, the major site of tuberculosis infection. This knowledge will be exploited to develop mucosal strategies for translating towards clinical evaluation and possible implementation. The interwoven activities will consolidate Europe’s leading role in TB vaccine research and innovation, with the ultimate goal of accelerated availability of affordable, accessible and more effective TB vaccines."

Improving treatment efficacy in hypertension by biomarker-guided personalised decision support	"In HT-ADVANCE we aim to revolutionise personalised management of arterial hypertension (HT) by using multi-omics (MOMICS) stratification biomarkers as companion diagnostics for the prescription of existing drugs. 
HT is the most important global risk factor for death and morbidity but is uncontrolled in more than 50% of patients. Causes of treatment failure include lack of identification of secondary forms such as endocrine hypertension (EHT) which can be curable by specific therapy.  In addition, there is variable response to individual drugs and trial-and-error treatment leads to poor HT control and frustration for both patients and clinicians.
The objective of HT-ADVANCE is to validate two multicomponent stratification biomarkers in patients with HT in order to i) identify patients with EHT, and ii) predict response to treatment in patients with primary hypertension.  The hypothesis is that MOMICS biomarkers reflect specific forms of hypertension and susceptibility to specific drugs. 
To this end, we will run three clinical trials (HT-ENDO, HT-TREAT and HT-PREDICT) and apply machine learning techniques to integrate the genetic, genomic and metabolomic features that constitute the MOMICS biomarkers in order to generate accurate diagnostic and therapeutic response predictions for clinicians. We will also perform economic evaluation of the use of MOMICS for the treatment of HT, produce ethical and legal recommendations for clinical decision making, and develop a plan for their implementation as companion diagnostics.
The study will be conducted by several HT Centres of Excellence and will build on the success of the ENSAT-HT project that has established methods and pipelines for integrating datasets derived from multiple platforms.  
We expect that HT-ADVANCE will provide a step change in the management of HT by enabling a personalised, more efficient and cost-effective treatment strategy, and importantly, will prevent the ensuing cardio-metabolic complications."	hypertension; endocrine hypertension; multicomponent biomarker; companion diagnostic; prediction; therapeutic response; personalised medicine; omics	INSTITUT NATIONAL DE LA SANTE ET DE LA RECHERCHE MEDICALE -	ASSISTANCE PUBLIQUE HOPITAUX DE PARIS -; CLINIQUES UNIVERSITAIRES SAINT-LUC ASBL -	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101095407/program/43108390/details	
Impact and viability of a novel mass PCR testing method as a pandemic-fighting strategy	"The COVID-19 pandemic has not only affected our health, but also our lifestyles and our economies. Given its high non-symptomatic transmissibility, to stop a pandemic-causing pathogen like SARS-CoV-2 early on its tracks without needing to resort to economy-damaging measures, would have required a mass testing strategy very early on: according to some estimates up to 10% of a nation’s population should have been tested on a daily basis to achieve this. Given the exponential growth tendency of pandemic-causing respiratory viruses, as soon as such pathogen is identified a large-scale testing campaign should immediate be deployed (a strategy adopted successfully in very densely populated areas of China). And given the long periods required to develop other pandemic-fighting strategies (i.e. such as vaccines and quick diagnostic tests), PCR-based mass testing could be the ideal front line of defense, since it can be developed in only a few weeks after decoding the genetic map of the pathogen. But although PCR testing capacity has greatly been increased worldwide, regularly testing large fractions of the population would still remain prohibitively costly with current technology.
The PCR-4-ALL consortium (combining expertise in diagnostics, high-throughput-screening, virology, disease modelling, econometrics and digital health platforms) will aim to demonstrate the technical feasibility of carrying out population-wide PCR testing by demonstrating a capacity of >10^5 tests in a single day and platform, in an extremely cost-effective manner (at least 2 orders of magnitude cheaper than currently). We will, furthermore, evaluate the effectiveness of utilizing this strategy as the main pandemic-fighting measure by assessing its ability to minimize, or even prevent, the need to implement other costly and partially ineffective measures (i.e. lockdowns and vaccination campaigns)."

Hyper-targeting CAR NK cells from induced pluripotent stem cells for novel off-the-shelf anti-tumor therapies	The HyperTargIPS-NK project aims to combine novel technologies from three research laboratories and a stem cell company to develop a revolutionary therapeutic modality for patients with devastating refractory malignancies. The treatment we propose is based on allogenic transplantation of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell-derived natural killer (NK) cells, genetically modified to a hyperactive state to ensure high potency NK cell targeting and destruction of tumor cells. CAR NK-based cancer treatment is an extremely promising new therapeutic avenue. However, the full potential of CAR NK therapies will only be achieved when an off-the-shelf product is rapidly accessible to patients in need. IPS with its unlimited expansion potential is the ideal cell source for NK-based products, however, improved efficiencies of NK cell production, suitably activated status, and resistance to immune suppression would need to be achieved. We have several breakthrough technologies to address these issues with 1) a novel iPS cell differentiation system based on our newly identified metabolic regulators that can be easily scaled to generate billions of functional NK cells, 2) identified and validated several novel and state-of-the-art CAR, non-CAR and TRUCK based regulators of NK activation to elicit the hyper activated NK cell state and prolonging NK survival, and 3) improved NK response to tumors via tumor microenvironment remodeling.  We will target the NK cells towards three life-threatening cancers for which novel treatment options are urgently needed as they are considered among the most lethal cancers; i.e. Pancreatic cancer, Glioblastoma, and Acute Myeloid leukemia (AML). Our iPS culture system, NK activation systems, and gene editing systems, have already been designed towards GMP compatibility. Taken together, these advances ensure that once this study is successful, our Hyper-Targ-IPS-NK cells are poised for rapid translation towards the clinic with our industrial partner.

Hydrogen oxidizing bacteria engineered to valorize CO2 for whey protein production	"Milk protein plays an important role in our nutrition, however classical milk production has significant environmental impacts, from greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to extensive land demand. Project HYDROCOW addresses these challenges through a net-zero carbon dairy protein production platform. The main objective of the project isto develop and demonstrate a bacterial protein secretion system where CO2 and soon N2 is valorised into food-grade protein, decoupled from agriculture. This system will base on the first-of-a-kind engineered hydrogen oxidizing bacterium (eHOB) Xanthobacter sp. SoF1. As a first product the main milk component beta-lactoglobulin was chosen.
Technically this will be achieved by implementing a Design-Build-Test-Learn (DBTL) cycle linked to a validation and scale-up phase allowing to iteratively optimize the production of secreted protein. The project will deliver key technologies – A) an innovative eHOB protein secretion system; B) predictive eHOB metabolic models, genetic engineering tools, and a novel high-throughput (HTP) screening system for DBTL cycling; and C) the methods for validation and scale-up – with immediate and long-term impact on the production of food and nutrition, materials, medicines, fuels and chemicals. 
In the long-term, the proposed platform has the potential to not only replace conventionally produced food proteins but also deliver proteins for materials or therapeutics, important for human and animal health. In comparison to current standard microbial production processes our platform does not compete with human nutrition for valuable feedstock, such as glucose, and therefore will contribute to a sustainable development of our society.

Hydrogen Optimized multi-fuel Propulsion system for clean and silEnt aircraft	"The ICAO Post-COVID forecasts estimate a 2.4%-4.1% increase for a low to high revenue passenger-kilometres growth rate. Air traffic growth inevitably increases aviation's combustion and acoustic emissions, hence aggravating aviation's environmental impact locally and globally. 
HOPE will deliver an integrated aircraft propulsion system comprising two multi-fuel ultra-high bypass ratio (UHBR) turbofan engines, a fuel cell based auxiliary propulsion and power unit (FC-APPU) driving an aft boundary layer ingestion (BLI) propulsor based on tube-wing aircraft configuration. The HOPE system: 1)minimises the combustion and noise emissions during landing and takeoff (LTO), hence the impact on air quality and noise annoyance near airports, without the trade-off of cruise emissions; 2)retrofits the existing aircraft configuration, allowing the substantial emission reduction to be achieved within a short time; 3)de-risks the use of hydrogen solely in existing tube-wing aircraft configurations; 4)smoothens aviation’s energy transition through assessment and exploitation of several greener propulsion technologies at different maturity level. 
HOPE emission goals consist of LTO NOx: -50%, CO: -50%, soot: -80%, perceived noise: -20% (~3 dB per operation), and climate impact: -30%, compared to state-of-the-art technology in 2020 (A320neo). To this end, HOPE will: 1)Design an integrated aircraft propulsion system accommodating multi-fuel (kerosene/sustainable aviation fuel +hydrogen) UHBR turbofan engines, FC-APPU, and an aft BLI propulsor; 2)Explore the novel idea of combining a BLI propulsor with FC-APPU for zero-emission taxiing; 3)Model, experiment, and demonstrate for the first time a low emission multi-fuel combustion technology burning H2+kerosene/SAF for future UHBR turbofan engine; 4)Assess societal impact, environmental burden, and cost benefits of the reduced noise and emissions by HOPE technology; 5)Formulate policy and recommendations to introduce HOPE technology."

Hybrid electronic-photonic architectures for brain-inspired computing	As artificial intelligence (AI) proliferates, hardware systems that can perform inference at ultralow latency, high precision and low power are crucial and urgently required to deal – especially quasi-locally, i.e. ‘in the edge’ – with massive and heterogenous data, respond in real time and avoid unintended consequences and function in complex and often unpredictable environments. Conventional digital electronics and the associated computer architecture is unable to meet these stringent requirements with sub-ms latency inference and a sub-10W power budget, using convolution neural networks (CNNs) on benchmarks such as ImageNet classification. HYBRAIN’s vision is to realize a pathway for a radical new technology with ultrafast (~1 microsecond) and energy-efficient (~1 watt) edge AI inference based on a world-first, brain-inspired hybrid architecture of integrated photonics and unconventional electronics. The deeply entwined memory and processing like in the mammalian brain obviates the need to shuttle around synaptic weights. The most stringent latency bottleneck in CNNs is in the initial convolution layers. Our approach will take advantage of the ultrahigh throughput and low latency of photonic convolutional processors (PCPs) employing novel phase-change materials in these initial layers to radically speed up processing. Their output is processed using cascaded electronic linear and nonlinear classifier layers, based on memristive (phase-change memory) crossbar arrays and dopant network processing units, respectively. HYBRAIN’s science-towards-technology breakthrough brings together the world’s top research groups from academia and industry in complementary technology platforms. Each of these platforms is already highly promising, but by integrating them, HYBRAIN will have a transformative effect of overcoming existing barriers of latency and energy consumption and will enable a whole new spectrum of edge AI applications throughout society.

Importantly, HuAbs targeting culprit and protective monocyte/macrophage (MoMP) populations that are instrumental in plaque progression will be crucial to assess disease status and reprogramme an unbalanced functional state toward atheroprotection. To translate this concept into clinical practice, the ABCardionostics consortium will combine cutting-edge biotechnologies and in silico and computing analyses to close the knowledge gaps on plaque MoMP spatiotemporal dynamics and the lack of imaging approaches for multi-marker detection: pioneering in vivo and in vitro phage display approaches to identify relevant HuAbs (UBx), multispectral mapping and MacroScreen to unravel the functionomics of MoMP subsets in atherosclerosis (MUNC), unvisited in silico and biochip development to identify HuAb targets (MAbS, CNRS-TBI), innovative HuAb bioengineering techniques (CNRS-BacFly, and UBx-INP, BTM), derivatization and labelling to develop PET tracers to finally explore the feasibility of a translational non-invasive multi-marker PET/MRI system for diagnosis and monitoring (CNIC) and an adapted immunotherapy strategy targeted to the appropriate plaque by designing bispecific antibodies (CNRS-BacFly). Data processing will integrate multimodal images to obtain insight into plaque morphology and composition (PMI). ABCardionostics successful completion will bring HuAb leads for atherosclerosis theranosis, and novel tools for HuAb identification and design, easily transposable to other diseases, revolutionizing the current imaging and therapeutic approaches.

Holistic and adaptivE Interface Design for human-technology Interactions	"Common adaptive vehicle HMIs implemented in today’s cars have limited sensing and predictive capabilities. Because of this, the risk is high to present information that is unsuitable for the current situation, which results in low usability and increased risk of distracting the driver. Furthermore, the exchange of information between driver and other road users is currently limited which often results in uncertain and unsafe situations. Driving automation only exacerbates the above-mentioned problem. External HMIs are one attempt to address this.

The HEIDI project aims to develop a fluid, cooperative HMI that integrates internal and external adaptive HMI solutions in a holistic manner. This cooperative HMI effectively synchronises driver data and data from other road users to facilitate an optimal joint action between the actors, following the foresight safety1 concept. With this, the HEIDI HMI solutions guarantee that all road users share the same understanding of the situation with a view to ensuring a safe interaction. To realise this overall aim several technical innovation modules will be developed. These new HMI solutions will be prototyped and validated in a multi-user simulation environment and in real vehicle prototypes. For this purpose, the HEIDI project brings together key industry and academic partners that provide a unique infrastructure for developing, testing, and validating the proposed HMI concepts, such as the co-simulation environment provided by VTI, where pedestrians and drivers can interact in the same experiment in two interconnected simulators, and the facilities provided by RUAS, where real vehicles can interact with real pedestrians in a safe environment. Additionally, the HEIDI project will develop recommendations for regulation and standardisation guidelines to EuroNCAP and to IEEE, especially focusing on external HMIs, as this area is still characterised by high uncertainty for manufacturers."	fluid & cooperative HMI; road safety; advanced sensing	VIRTUAL VEHICLE RESEARCH GMBH - VIF	BAYERISCHE MOTOREN WERKE AKTIENGESELLSCHAFT - BMW GROUP; HOCHSCHULE REUTLINGEN - TECHNIK-WIRTSCHAFT-INFORMATIK-DESIGN - Reutlingen University	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101069538/program/43108390/details	
Highly Integrated Versatile Laser Source enabling two-photon excitation in digital diagnostics and biomedical research	The overall objective of HILIGHT is to implement innovative solutions into versatile light sources and systems as tools for biomedical and healthcare applications centred around two-photon excitation fluorescence lifetime measurements and imaging microscopy. We propose two specific use cases: i) instantaneous digital histopathology and ii) biomedical research in the context of cancer research and diagnostics. HILIGHT proposes a miniaturised and versatile optical pulse burst source together with innovative sensing technology that will permit us to overcome those limitations in SoA instrumentation that often confine the use of two-photon microscopy and time-resolved detection to the specialist laboratory. We envisage that the HILIGHT innovations could disrupt activities in various fields and a range of market segments, including academic and research institutions, biotechnology, and medical facilities. These include applications targeted to improve our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of disease using in vivo, ex vivo, or 3D organotypic cultures, with the ultimate aim of developing better tools for fast and early diagnosis and more effective therapeutic interventions. HILIGHT is structured around nine work packages covering the whole value chain, coherently with the concept of the project standing on strong enabling technology foundations and targeting biophotonic and medical application domains. HILIGHT consortium is made up of five leading partners from various fields experienced in European collaborative projects and from five different European countries (FR, DE, IT, CH and UK). HILIGHT is built on several prior and ongoing successful collaborations between partners, which provides a strong guarantee for successful interaction within the consortium, and a smooth implementation of the workplan.

High-throughput oligonucleotide synthesis and NGS for Digital TEXT Storage And retrieval in DNA encapsulated nanofibers	"Incorporating biomolecules as integral parts of computational systems represents a frontier challenge in bio and nanotechnology. Using DNA to store digital data is an attractive alternative to conventional information technologies due to its high information density and long lifetime. However, developing an adequate DNA storage medium remains a significant challenge in permitting the safe archival and retrieval of oligonucleotides.

TextaDNA introduces polymer fibres as a novel approach to encapsulating and retrieving information-carrying oligonucleotides. We will develop a complete DNA storage workflow, encoding digital information into DNA base sequences and optimising oligonucleotide synthesis and encapsulation in polymer nano and microfibres. The project is led by nanoGUNE, a nanotechnology research centre, and partners with Eurofins, a leading European company specialising in state-of-art oligo synthesis and next-generation sequencing. We will design next-generation sequencing assays to automate the DNA digital storage readout retrieved from fibres. The enhanced oligo synthesis and sequencing strategies that, TextaDNA will develop are of fundamental interest in the path toward broader use of DNA digital storage, increasing synthesis speed and length of oligos and reducing costs. The consortium will create the conditions for encapsulating oligonucleotides inside polymer fibres and methods to retrieve them. We will establish efficient methods of synthesising oligonucleotides going beyond state-of-art phosphorodiamidate chemistry while ensuring their stability. Further, TextaDNA will also explore ways of incorporating sequencing technologies into reading digital data stored in oligonucleotide pools and expand the data storage capabilities of DNA.

TextaDNA will add to the European leadership in DNA data digital storage by leveraging oligo synthesis and sequencing with nanotechnology to build DNA digital storage materials."

High mobilitY Printed nEtwoRks of 2D Semiconductors for advanced electrONICs	FFuture technological innovations in areas such as the Internet of things and wearable electronics require cheap, easily deformable and reasonably performing printed electronic circuitries. However, current state-of-the-art (SoA) printed electronic devices show mobilities of ~10 cm2/Vs, about ×100 lower than traditional Si-electronics. A promising solution to print devices from 2D semiconducting nanosheets gives relatively low mobilities (~0.1 cm2/Vs) due to the rate-limiting nature of charge transfer (CT) across inter-nanosheet junctions. By minimising the junction resistance RJ, the mobility of printed devices could match that of individual nanosheets, i.e., up to 1000 cm2/Vs for phosphorene, competing with Si. HYPERSONIC is a high-risk, high-gain interdisciplinary project exploiting new chemical and physical approaches to minimise RJ in printed nanosheet networks, leading to ultra-cheap printed devices with a performance ×10–100 beyond the SoA. The chemical approach relies on chemical crosslinking of nanosheets with (semi)conducting molecules to boost inter-nanosheet CT. The physical approach involves synthesising high-aspect-ratio nanosheets, leading to low bending rigidity and increased inter-nanosheet interactions, yielding conformal, large-area junctions of >10e4 nm2 to dramatically reduce RJ. Our radical new technology will use a range of n- or p-type nanosheets to achieve printed networks with mobilities of up to 1000 cm2/Vs. A comprehensive electrical characterisation of all nanosheet networks will allow us to not only identify those with ultra-high mobility but also to fully control the relation between basic physics/chemistry and network mobility. We will demonstrate the utility of our technology by using our best-performing networks as complementary field-effect devices in next- generation, integrated, wearable sensor arrays. Printed digital and analog circuits will read and amplify sensor signals, demonstrating a potential commercialisable application.

High Q factOr MiniaturizEd low Mass (Accoustic) filters for highly DEmanding space applications	The HOMEMADE project falls directly into the scope of the HORIZON EUROPE policy: “To reduce the dependence on critical technologies and capabilities from outside Europe for future space applications”. We target a fast growing market which integrates communication satellites in 5G networks that will reduce digital divide  by meeting latent demand for digital broadband. The project aims at developing a truly new Surface Acoustic Wave(SAW) filter technology not yet available to space industry. This innovation based on Piezo-On-Insulator (POI) wafers already produced for Smart phone industry is not accessible to space industry due to market size and its own high reliability specificities. Compared to existing technologies, POI-based SAW filters enable high integration, temperature stability, thermal management, low insertion loss and high rejection with various bandwidths in L- and S-band frequencies, replacing leaky waves on usual piezoelectric substrates by real guided waves on Silicon-based wafers. This project will deliver, as first pillar, POI-based SAW filters for space industry up to a TRL7 addressing all volume demands, in line with Geosynchronous Earth Orbiting satellites to Low Earth Orbiting satellite constellations. The supply chain for key items such as POI wafer supply, to front-end and back-end process is based in Europe. The high demand of innovation yielding reduced mass in satellites especially for new growing markets within a limited access time, has pushed to develop in HOMEMADE a second pillar that will deliver disruptive POI based SAW filters able to compete with bulky mechanical filters. The value chain includes European supplier of specific acoustic passive SOI-FREC as part of the SOITEC group with space integrator and technology supplier TAS, UCL and SME INC both world leaders in the field POI based material and device optimization, and finally ALT European centre of excellence for space reliability of high complexity active and passive components.

HYdrogen eLectrical Engine Novel Architecture	"HYLENA will investigate, develop and optimize an innovative, highly efficient, hydrogen powered electrical aircraft propulsion concept. This is based on the integration and combination of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFC) with turbomachinery in order to use both the electric and thermal energy for maximisation of propulsive efficiency. This game-changing engine will exploit the synergistic use of:
a) an electrical motor: the main driver for propulsion,
b) hydrogen fueled SOFC stacks: geometrically optimized for nacelle integration,
c) a gas turbine: to thermodynamically integrate the SOFC. 
This concept will achieve significant climate impact reduction by being completely carbon neutral with radical increase of overall efficiency for short and medium range aircrafts. The HYLENA methodology covers on:
- SOFC cell level: experimental investigations on new high-power density cell technologies
- SOFC stack level: studies and tests to determine the most light-weight and manufacturable way of stack integration
- Thermodynamic level: engine cycle simulations of novel HYLENA concept architectures
- Engine design level: exploration, through resilient calculation and simulation, of the best engine design, sizing and overall components integration
- Overall engine efficiency level: demonstration that HYLENA concept can reach an efficiency increase of more than 50 % compared to state-of-the-art turbofan engines
- Demonstration level: a decision dossier for a potential ground test demonstrator to prove that the concept works in practice during a second phase of the project
The HYLENA consortium consists of one aircraft manufacturer (Airbus), 3 universities and 2 research institutes covering the expertise in aircraft design, propulsion system design, SOFC technology, hydrogen combustion and climate impact assessment. This project is fully complementary to Clean-Aviation to investigate a low level TRL concept and bring it to TRL3 in 42 months prior to a demonstrator in phase 2."

HLA-homozygous iPSC-cardiomyocytE Aggregate manufacturing technoLogies for allogenic cell therapy to the heart	"HEAL will focus on general bottlenecks to induced pluripotent stem cell therapies with a particular focus on heart failure, which remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality with very few treatment options.

HLA-homozygous cell line derived cardiomyocyte aggregates offer the prospect of a restorative heart therapy applicable to large patient populations and to overcome economic barriers associated with autologous approaches. By developing solutions for their mass-production and cryopreservation we will enable allogeneic treatment with minimum requirements for immunosuppression.

Assays for assessment of immunogenicity will provide data for the development of an artificial intelligence powered algorithm to predict recipients's immune responses for personalised design of immunosuppression protocols.

A potency assay to assure product effectiveness will be developed together with assays of tumorigenicity in vitro and in vivo that meet and exceed current regulatory requirements. A genetic integrity pipeline defining the most sensitive assays for rigorous assessment will be developed and a rescue tool in the form of a  biallelic suicide gene for programmed cell death will add to the safety toolbox for the  therapy.

Optimisation of cell-product administration in terms of retention and engraftment, including catheter-based delivery as minimally invasive alternative to surgical application, and assessment of risks of graft-induced arrhythmia will be determined in a pig model. 

Early dialogues, via established links, to the regulatory authorities will ensure proper development according to GMP requirements.

Freedom to operate and licensing strategies with a health technology and infrastructure assessment of European centres will set the scene for approval of the cell product and related assays and protocols for storage and distribution required to progress towards a first in man study of cell-based heart repair."

HIGH-TC JOSEPHSON NEURONS AND SYNAPSES: TOWARDS ULTRAFAST AND ENERGY EFFICIENT SUPERCONDUCTING NEUROMORPHIC COMPUTING	"We aim at realizing a novel class of high-temperature Josephson junctions (JJs) that behave as artificial neurons and synapses. These JJs will enable a new neuromorphic computing paradigm, in which neural networks are much faster, more energy efficient and compact than with non-superconducting approaches, and possess novel capabilities (combined sensitivity to light, magnetic and electric fields). Via these rupture ingredients, JOSEPHINE will dramatically enhance the impact of neuromorphics on its broad range of projected applications: from artificial intelligence (where it would allow supercomputer-level processors at a fraction of the environmental cost) to the control of autonomous vehicles, the Internet of Things, and novel medical applications. That constitutes the long-term vision for the science we propose. To reach that goal, we will use different strategies to realize high-Tc Josephson junctions whose weak-links are active and can be changed ""in operando"" by external stimuli. Those strategies include ""weak links"" modified by a nanoscale redox reaction, by the motion of domain walls in a ferromagnet, or by locally doping a graphene or a 2D semiconductor. Once realized, these JJs will be implemented and tested in neural networks to demonstrate their performance and their transformative effect on neuromorphics. The proposed strategy exploits recent breakthrough results of the partners (physical effects that will be implemented) and synergizes their complementary expertise via a multidisciplinary approach that marries traditionally distant disciplines: neural network engineering, superconducting electronics, and various facets of solid-state physics (superconductivity, magnetism, Dirac materials, and electrochemistry)."	superconducting electronics; cuprates; Josephson devices; cryogenic memory; proximity effects; graphene; quantum circuits; quantum electronics,	CENTRE NATIONAL DE LA RECHERCHE SCIENTIFIQUE CNRS - CNRS	AGENCIA ESTATAL CONSEJO SUPERIOR DE INVESTIGACIONES CIENTIFICAS - CSIC; CHALMERS TEKNISKA HOGSKOLA AB -	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101130224/program/43108390/details	
GreenH2 production from water and bioalcohols by full solar spectrum in a flow reactor	"Water splitting for H2 production driven by solar energy is quite attractive while the current efficiency is very moderate due to both the extremely sluggish water oxidation half reaction and limited light harvesting (mostly UV-visible light). In addition, the separation of one product H2 from the other O2 during water splitting is very costly.  
The project is designed to address these challenges by i) utilizing the full solar spectrum (300-2500nm) instead of UV-visible light (300-700nm), ii) coupling water splitting with biomass-derivative oxidation to avoid water oxidation, iii) well combining solid Z-scheme UV-visible photocatalysis and Infrared-driven thermal catalysis, and iv) using a flow double tube reactor other than batch reactors, thus  targeting to produce green H2 from both water and biomass with a high quantum yield of 60% . Furthermore the project will co-produce high-value chemicals with a high selectivity of >90%. In addition, the integration of low-cost and efficient catalysts with novel flow reactors will assure a continuous and efficient production of H2 and high-value chemicals. The entire process does not use fossil fuels nor produce CO2, thus a zero carbon-emission technology. Finally the system can be readily scaled up by numbering up the reactor modules. All these are built upon a multidisciplinary and international consortium with the global experts in photocatalysis, thermal catalysis, reactor engineering, product separation, simulation and social science. Therefore the scientific and technical challenges, as well as the environmental, societal and economic impacts will be fully addressed in the project. The proposed technology will typically benefit the EU economy by an innovative green H2 production process from water and biomass, heavily contributing to a low carbon society. In addition, the international team including members from Asia will facilitate the technology exploitation out of the EU, to further benefit the EU economy."

Green valorization of CO2 and Nitrogen compounds for making fertilizers	CONFETI project proposes the development of a lab-scale validated innovative technology that is able to utilise and electrochemically convert CO2 and N2 directly from air or flue gases without the use of critical raw materials and using renewable energy sources. By the production of urea from N (N2 and/or NO3-) and CO2, the project aims to ensure a circular and renewable carbon and nitrogen economy by recycling and converting the NO3- not consume by the plant into ammonia or urea using photocatalytic technologies based on sunlight. The technology proposed in the current project to synthetize and deliver urea fertilizer to plants will follow sustainable agriculture models by promoting the efficiency of available resources, the sustainability of the agricultural sector, the preservation of the environment and the safety and quality of products. For many countries, agriculture is the dominant sector in developing the economy.

Green and Sustainable Processes for Electrode Production	"Lithium-ion technology is the means to greener and more sustainable mobility and other mobile applications, but the process of cell manufacturing is still energy consuming and using environmentally harmful substances. The greenSPEED project offers solutions for new sustainable electrode and cell manufacturing processes with reduced energy consumption, lower carbon footprint and ZERO Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) emissions.
To that aim, the project main target is developing a battery cell comprised of electrodes manufactured by innovative dry processes. Our composite cathode, based on Ni-rich NMC, is to be manufactured by scalable roll-to-roll dry electrode coating process, that fully removes the use of casting-solvents and eliminates the need of energy-intense drying-, condensate and transportation process required in state-of-the-art electrode fabrication. The greenSPEED high-capacity pure-silicon anode is to be manufactured taking full advantage of our innovative process based on Microwave-Assisted Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition (MW-PECVD), which deposits porous silicon directly on the copper current-collector starting from locally produced silane gas (SiH4). Moreover, the use of advanced modelling and simulation techniques including digital twins, artificial intelligence, and machine learning are to be employed to predict and optimise cell performance in early development stages, support the cell production process by virtually assessing the influence and importance of production parameters and thus minimising the number of experiments and to accelerate electrode production optimisation steps. The greenSPEED cell aims at increasing energy density (+69%) while reducing energy consumption (-32%) and costs (-21%) of production as compared to state-of-the-art Li-ion cells. The concepts here proposed have been already demonstrated at TRL 2/3 with the aim of reaching TRL 5/6 by the end of the project."	battery; green process; sustainability; Artificial Intelligence; Digital Twin	VIRTUAL VEHICLE RESEARCH GMBH - VIF	ARKEMA FRANCE SA - ARKEMA; AVL LIST GMBH - AVL	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101069528/program/43108390/details	
Green H2 and circular bio-coal from biowaste for cost-competitive sustainable Steel	The achievement of the Net-zero emissions target established by the European Commission is huge challenge which could not be achieved without re-thinking the conventional route (materials and energy chains). H2STEEL project proposes an innovative, disruptive solution to convert wet waste streams into green Hydrogen, Carbon and Critical Raw Materials. The proposed innovative solution aims at supporting the green transition of one of the most hard-to-abate industrial sector: metallurgy.  In particular, H2STEEL combines the conversion of biowaste and bioCH4 through innovative catalyzed pyrolysis with chemical leaching, to fully convert biowastes into Green Hydrogen, Green Carbon (biocoal), and recovery of Critical (inorganic) Raw Materials. Biomethane pyrolysis is carried out in a brand new, ad-hoc designed, and proof-of-concept reactor, on a bed of biocoal made from pre-carbonized biowastes, i.e. on a very cheap fully carbon-based catalyst, very resistant to temperature and contaminants: this will enhance the efficiency of the methane cracking step to generate Green Hydrogen. As new solid carbon from methane cracking is generated on the biocoal surface, thus reducing the performance of the catalyst, new biocoal-catalyst is inserted in the reactor, while the spent biocoal is removed: the continuous renewal of the catalyst is feasible thanks to its low cost, and to the market value of the spent catalyst. This material, fully bio-carbon based, is then used in steel-making as a substitute of metallurgical (fossil) coke, generating a net GHG reduction, EU ETS (Emission Trading Scheme) compliant. The regeneration of the spent catalyst thus becomes unnecessary, as the biocoal is used in a downstream process, avoiding the release of CO2 in atmosphere (as it happens in the SMR process or in most of the catalysts regeneration steps).

Gene Therapy for treatment of rare inherited Arrhythmogenic Cardiomyopathy	"Development of a cure for rare cardiac diseases is a risky, costly and time-consuming process, which is hampered by insufficient insight into pathophysiological mechanisms of the diseases and lack of relevant disease models. 
The GEREMY consortium proposes to overcome this challenge by developing a gene therapy (GT) for inherited arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (ACM), by targeting the disease-causing PLN (non-desmosomes) and PKP2 (cardiac desmosomes) mutations. The GEREMY consortium will apply a unique parallel approach and investigate various promising GT approaches (oligonucleotide chemistries, gene editing and gene delivery). Also, the consortium will engineer disease models for proper assessment of therapeutic interventions and aims to provide in vitro & in vivo preclinical proof-of-concept for the GT.
A significant benefit compared to current technologies is that the GT has the potential to be a curative treatment for rare cardiac diseases. Based on previous successes, GEREMY will target PLN & PKP2 as a roadmap of the technology. Restoring the primary defect in the PLN & PKP2 genes that cause the disease will lead to preserving or even restoring myocardial contractility. Through this approach, GEREMY will work towards a curative treatment of inherited ACM and likely other cardiomyopathies, which significantly reduces the healthcare burden. 
The project’s experts in preclinical research and cardiac genetics will deliver preclinical efficacy and safety data for the mutation correction. The partners with regulatory and clinical trial expertise (EXOM, EUF, NLHI) will prepare for immediate start of clinical trials upon project completion, and apply for orphan drug designation. EUPATI, a patient organisation and KUL ethics partner will ensure that the project is continuously aligned with patient needs and ethical perspectives.

GREEN AGILE SEMICONDUCTOR PRODUCTION	"Flexible Electronics has been one of the fastest developing technologies in recent decades. The traditional path is electronic components such as silicon chips (e.g., microcontrollers) integrated onto flexible substrates called “hybrid integration” or “flexible hybrid electronics” in integrated smart systems. We believe that this approach is not a viable long-term solution for future high-volume, low-cost and conformable integrated smart systems.  Our vision is an integrated smart system that is built with only flexible electronic components including analogue circuitry, digital logic and memories. We call such a system a “Natively Flexible Integrated Smart System” or NFISS. NFISSes will enable new products in the Fast Moving Consumer Goods and healthcare wearables that have not been possible before because conventional silicon chips are too costly, too bulky and not conformable. 

The project will develop a flexible microcontroller unit (FlexMCU), which is the key component missing to enable NFISSes. The FlexMCU must be a low-power chip integrating a variety of functionality to address the functional requirements of the applications in FMCG and healthcare wearables. A novel hybrid complementary low-power thin-film transistor technology (100x per-transistor power reduction) will be developed to fabricate the FlexMCU in a sustainable flexible chip fab with 100-1000x less environmental footprint. The FlexMCU design is tailored to a specific domain composed of an open-source RISC-V based processor with built-in security features, an analogue frontend, on-chip memory and other peripherals. Then, the FlexMCU will be assembled using novel assembly and bonding methods onto a flexible film, which is, in turn, integrated onto a flexible substrate along with other flexible electronic components to build the first proof-of-concept NFISS that will be validated on two healthcare wearable applications."

Future enabLing technologies for hYdrogen-powered Electrified aero engine for Clean aviatiOn	"FlyECO will deliver transformative technologies to support Integrated Power and Propulsion Systems (IPPS) that contributes to zero-emission and sustainable growth of aviation and has the potential to enable aviation climate neutrality by 2050. The utilization of hydrogen as sole energy source offers the opportunity to eliminate aviation CO2 emissions entirely. Furthermore, a reduction in NOx emissions of at least 50% is enabled by ingesting steam produced by a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) into the hydrogen-fuelled gas turbine (GT). FlyECO will develop a simulation and evaluation framework in which the optimal architecture definition of the IPPS, the key enabling integration technologies and necessary controls concepts can be explored, investigated closely and advanced towards TRL3 through Proof-of-Concept (PoC) demonstrators. A Commuter/Regional aircraft application was chosen as a use case to develop the propulsion system with more than one megawatt power. In particular, the energy management and distribution strategies will be developed for both quasi-steady-state and transient operation. In addition, PoC for the IPPS and the reduction in NOx emissions will be provided via two demonstrators: (1) a sub-structured test-rig emulating the cycle-integrated hybrid-electric propulsion system and (2) a high-pressure combustor with steam ingestion.  The outcome of FlyECO will be comprise of:
-An advanced simulation platform to analyse the impact of the SOFC integration on a hydrogen GT
-A validation methodology for novel energy and power management strategies for the IPPS architecture
-A controls approach for the IPPS, including specialised local control for components and subsystems as well as global control

Future Lives with Oceans and Waters	"Future Lives with Oceans and Waters (FLOW) will enable co-ownership, co-responsibility and co-implementation of the young generation to co-create effective, target-group oriented and actionable blueprints for stewardship assemblages featuring social interaction and engagement with sea and waters. In doing so, FLOW will contribute to the Restore our Oceans by 2030 Mission. The project's innovative design brings together diverse young people from all across Europe with an excellent, interdisciplinary research team. Our research is built along a chain of direct cooperation with young people via 1) the FLOW Youth advisory board, 2) the European network of youth-focused NGOs, 3) Experiential futures workshops with young people from seven regions across Europe and 4) Youth-stakeholder co-creation.

FLOW will go beyond instrumental treatment of knowledge about the young generation 1) by a novel transdisciplinary research approach (‘inFLOW lens’) studying their expectations, engagements, and human-nature relationship with the seas and waters; 2) by bringing together policy-makers, researchers and other relevant stakeholders together with the youth and engaging them in co-creation of stewardship assemblages. Insights from FLOW will support shaping future policies. All stakeholders claim to represent the interests of young and future generations. FLOW develops a new approach of co-creating future policies that mitigates the risk of naively generalizing and amplifying statements of young people that are made amid, and despite of, vested interests and debates that are polarized between nature-connectedness, preservation and conservation on the one side and resource use, value creation and economic prosperity on the other side. 

To fully raise the potential that is embedded in FLOW's structure and generate scientifically-sound, un-biased and non-partisan insights, we base cooperation and co-creation with young people on scientific rigour, reflexivity and evidence assured."	youth engagement and mobilization; transdisciplinary research; human-nature relations; foresight; environmental psychology; sociology and philosophy; nature conservation management	STICHTING RADBOUD UNIVERSITEIT -	FRAUNHOFER GESELLSCHAFT ZUR FORDERUNG DER ANGEWANDTEN FORSCHUNG EV - Fraunhofer; UNIVERSITETET I TROMSOE - NORGES ARKTISKE UNIVERSITET - UiT	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101093928/program/43108390/details	
Future Data Storage Using Colloidal Memory Technology	"Data is being generated at ever-increasing rates with the widespread digital transformation in businesses and society. The continually increasing demand for affordable data storage puts tremendous pressure on storage technologies. New concepts for low-cost, high-storage-density memories are urgently needed to keep storage capabilities in line with the growing demand. FastComet is a colloidal memory concept in which colloidal nanoparticles are considered data carriers. The memory consists of a large array of nanocapillaries in which two types of nanoparticles with antagonistic electrophoresis (DEP) properties can be selectively inserted into the capillary by DEP forces. Data can be stored as the specific stacking sequence of the different particle types. A CMOS circuit at the periphery of the array addresses and controls the electrodes. The long-term aim is to develop an integrated device that is able to store data using nanoparticles smaller than 15 nm. This would ultimately result in ultra-high bit densities exceeding 100 Gbit per square millimeter and potentially reaching 1 Tbit square millimeter at a lower cost than existing data storage technologies. 
In the FastComet project, we aim to establish a proof-of-concept for colloidal memory by identifying suitable nanoparticles, developing nanofabricated test structures, using advanced nanoscopy imaging techniques to demonstrate the selective manipulation of nanoparticles into passive nanocapillary arrays, and establishing a modeling framework for future technology development.

Full spectrum SOLar Direct Air Capture & conversion	Ethylene is the chemical industry’s primary building block. SolDAC’s ambition is to reinvent the ethylene industry by proving (TRL4) an emerging breakthrough technology for producing technically and economically competitive, socially desirable and climate-neutral (sustainable) ethylene and co-product ethanol (C2 products) from solar energy and air. The project features a photo-electrochemical conversion (PEC) unit, being electrochemistry the only possible route for direct conversion of carbon dioxide into ethylene. The PEC exploits bandwidth-selected light from a solar collector (FSS) that splits the solar spectrum for electricity and heat generation at efficiency higher than standalone PV modules and standalone solar thermal collectors. Heat is used in an innovative direct air capture (DAC) unit at ultralow temperature (~60°C), fostering the eventual circular integration with heat networks. The DAC unit removes carbon dioxide from the air, concentrates it to 95+% and compresses it to feed the PEC stack and a pipeline for carbon dioxide storage. This allows the carbon footprint of the whole sun-to-chemicals process to be offset and enables gain in carbon credits, opening an opportunity to exceed climate-neutrality and produce carbon-negative C2 products. The process is energetically self-sufficient, economically viable and carbon-negative on the condition that each unit (DAC, PEC, FSS) reach new targets in efficiency. That is exactly the high-risk/high return outcome expected in the project. The research is balanced to overcome technical, early-stage social and market barriers by exploiting the expertise of its 8 partners (SMEs in the renewable technology field, leading EU research institutions and one networking NGO). This project performs all the necessary groundwork for the full deployment of the process before 2050 through activities that build up a new ecosystem of stakeholders, making Europe the first circular, climate-neutral and sustainable economy.	zero-carbon; solar energy; air mining; Negative Emission Technologies (NET); Direct Air Capture (DAC); photo-electrochemical conversion (PEC); full spectrum solar collector (FSS)	COMET GLOBAL INNOVATION, SL - COMET	CONSIGLIO NAZIONALE DELLE RICERCHE - CNR; EUROPEAN INNOVATION MARKETPLACE ASBL -	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101069359/program/43108390/details	
Full eurOpean hdi pCb and assembly sUpply chain for Space and INdustrial seGments	"FOCUSING is a powerful playground in which outstanding, worldwide recognized European companies with complementary expertise and state-of-the-art facilities will share and merge their experience with the ultimate goal of exploring and exploiting novel green-oriented routes towards the significant upgrading of the current printed circuit board (PCB) and surface mount technology (SMT) and the enhancement of the overall European competitiveness. Even though space market is addressed in priority, other applications may be addressed.

The growing trend towards miniaturization and the demand of ever more compact and integrated devices have led to an ever increasing interest in printed circuit board with embedded components and in HDI boards, both for the multiple potentialities of a technical-productive nature, and for the encouraging growth prospects of the market demand.

Despite improved manufacturing HDI technologies have been widely demonstrated,  and exploited e.g. for automotive, biomedical, and commercial applications, incorporating these improvements in capability with space reliability requirements still representing a challenge.

In this project, HDI technology is considered pivotal for the integration of cutting-edge electronic solutions able to revolutionize the design of present and future products (e.g. from standard sized to micro and nano satellites) by reducing the payload and boosting the performances of the space equipment.

The objective of the proposed activity is double :

•            To develop and validate state-of-the-art building blocks to demonstrate the reliability of the technologies and processes developed

•            To build a fully European competitive, sustainable and independent supply chain based on state-of-the-art laminates and cutting-edge HDI PCB manufacturing technology focused on advanced Space applications but potentially benefiting as well to other applications."

Freestanding energy-to-Hydrogen fuel by water splitting using Earth-abundant materials in a novel, eco-friendly, sustainable and scalable photoelectrochemical Cell system	The FreeHydroCells project aims to create a new photoelectrochemical system capable of clean, efficient solar-to-chemical energy conversion, with hydrogen gas storing the chemical energy. The system would mimic the solar-energy absorption potential of a leaf by arraying cascades of nanometre thick semiconducting materials as buried pn-junctions that, when submerged in water and exposed to sunlight, are capable of freestanding photoelectrochemical water splitting. A number of technological challenges restrict the cost-effective efficiency of clean, green, solar-to-chemical hydrogen, state-of-the-art systems, making it commercially unattractive, and severely limiting hydrogen’s role in decarbonisation. However, the FreeHydroCells project proposes to leverage a number of advancements in thin film materials, devices, and processes to make similar breakthroughs in photoelectrochemical band-engineering for interconnected bands, defect minimisation, thin film thickness uniformity continuity to minimise drift-dominated transit times, carrier doping for high conductivity, carrier type selectivity and, importantly, preventing significant recombination of light-generated carriers by ensuring drift transport under multiple in-built electric fields. These breakthroughs would transform the transfer efficiency of solar-to-chemical energy via the carefully aligned redox potential and propel the photoelectrochemical water splitting reactions to morph solar energy into hydrogen bonds. The new materials system could be cost-effectively realised through modified delivery techniques of atomic layer deposition and chemical vapour deposition in manufacturing-compatible, large-area capable, equipment that is now common in commercial chip and solar cell processing technologies. FreeHydroCells’ multidisciplinary expertise is key to making this substantial science-to-technology leap: to verify a paradigm proof-of-concept for a self-driven system suitable for up-scaling and commercialisation.

For Tunable Thermochemical Energy Storage	To accelerate the energy transition there is an urgent need for energy storage both for electricity and heat due to the intermittency of renewable resources. As a large part of our energy consumption is in form of thermal energy (78% in the built environment), and as there is a large amount of unused low temperature waste heat (8900 PJ in Europe), thermal energy storage offers route towards bridging availability and demand. Long term loss-free compact heat storage is the missing link, and Thermo-Chemical Energy Storage (TCES) has the potential to play this role. Unfortunately, present TCES concepts lack flexibility as a precise fit between the phase diagram of TCES-materials, the system design and the temperature demand of an application is needed. Therefore, most of the R&D for applying TCES is very specific for a particular application and switching to another application requires that much of the R&D process has to be redone. 4TunaTES will deliver a groundbreaking flexible TCES technology that can be easily adapted to different applications (variable in- and output temperatures) and thereby reduce the development costs by 90% as the R&D the process does not have be redone repeatedly. 4TunaTES develops a TCES-prototype that can be used for domestic use cases, which addresses three challenges: 1) radically new TCES materials with tunable phase diagrams by using a second gas or dopants, 2) heat exchanging components with a high degree of manufacturing flexibility, and 3) revolutionary systems with electricity adapted thermodynamic cycles. CNR and DLR will integrate the key findings in their high-TRL project portfolio, and Cellcius (CEL) will integrate the successful materials and designs in their technology. This will unlock the potential thermal energy storage. For this purpose, a strong consortium has been built which brings together computational material scientists (VUB), physical-chemists (TUE), mechanical engineers (CNR, DLR) and heat battery developer (CEL).

Flexible, Safe and efficient REcycling of Li-ion batterieS for a comPetitive, circular, and sustainable European battery manufaCTuring industry	"In the context of increasing global battery use, developing sustainable, safe and efficient processes is a tangible issue to further enhance circular economy and strategic autonomy of the European Li-ion batteries value chain, in line with the battery partnership’s objectives launched under Horizon Europe.

RESPECT main objective is to develop a global process encompassing a process-chain flexible enough to treat all kind of batteries in closed loop, considering the variability of Li-ion batteries chemistries (NMC, LFP, NCA, LMO) , applications (EV and ESS) and states (aged, damaged, EoL, production scraps) up to date not covered by any process on the State of the Art. RESPECT addresses two recycling routes: full hydrometallurgy and direct recycling and an improved Life Cycle Assessment of each recycling segment to lower emissions and reduce secondary pollution, safety and health risks.  

RESPECT will aim to design and validate the recycling processes up to pilot scale to recovering the highest amount of resources, including CRMs and active materials present in the batteries to closing the loop by their reuse in cathode and anode materials for new batteries. Socio-economic, as well as sustainability aspects will be covered throughout the project. To ensure a successful project implementation, knowledge sharing on Li-ion battery green recycling processes will be fostered, based on the engagement with relevant international stakeholders and experts through the advisory board.

Based on a solid and interdisciplinary consortium of partners covering the whole value chain, RESPECT seeks high recovery rates (for Li, Mn, Co, Ni or graphite) with low environmental impact and strong energy savings, in accordance with the European Green Deal and the proposed Battery Regulation.

Flexible and hybrid manufacturing of green aluminium to produce tailored adaptive crash-tolerant structures	"Flexcrash aims to develop a flexible and hybrid manufacturing technology based on applying surface patterns by additive manufacturing onto preformed parts. Aluminium alloys have been selected as the optimum material to build high performance structures, addressing both lightweight and environmental sustainability. They provide better recyclability, affordability (low CRM content), and costs than other material alternatives that would need complex developments for joining, recycling, and manufacturing. The property tailoring capacity offered by hybrid manufacturing will permit to develop a new type of crash-tolerant structures with outstanding performance under a wide range of impact angles and unexpected crash conditions. Structures will be defined according to the collision parameters identified by the different mixed traffic scenarios. Such tailored structures are the ideal solutions for dynamic active safety devices that allows displacement of crash structures to optimally face an imminent crash. Considering that the frontal crash is the most common (70%), a front-end structure has been  chosen as demonstrator to validate the manufacturing developments, the modelling approach and the testing methodologies. The flexibility of the proposed technology will facilitate its transferability to other safety-related structures in vehicle’s locations with higher risk for passenger’s injuries while decreasing the number of materials and processes used to manufacture a crash structure. Simplify supply chain will turn into 20% manufacturing costs saving and reduce the risk of disruption. 
Virtual testing with improved reliability, validated by crash tests, will be used to propose new testing configurations, looking at the next step towards standardization. The application of Flexcrash solutions to the whole BiW offers a lightweighting potential up to 20% with improved safety (toward 50% reduction of passenger’s injuries and fatalities).

Flat Bands for Quantum Metrology	"The ultimate limit on the accuracy of any measurement is set by quantum mechanics, this also means that quantum effects can be used in metrology and sensing to go well beyond any classical approach. For classical systems, statistical error is proportional to 1/sqrt(N) with N the number of measured particles. Measurements in quantum systems can overcome this limit and reach the Heisenberg limit proportional to 1/N. However, quantum standards and sensors are challenging to put in practice and their working conditions are nowadays intrinsically incompatible (e.g. magnetic field and superconductivity). Therefore, limiting their reach in terms of users and their development as accurate and enhanced quantum technologies. 
The vision we propose in FLATS is to use twisted bilayer graphene as a multiphenomena platform to develop present electrical quantum metrology standards, working under compatible conditions, and to develop the new generation of metrological sensor, going beyond the International System of units (SI). Their common platform will allow their integration as a single multi-use on-chip quantum lab.
To achieve this, we will first create a European twistronics plateform for an unprecedented control of the relative angular alignment between graphene/BN layers.  We will develop novel and original quantum electrical standards with twisted heterostructures.  Our on-chip metrological quantum lab also enables the implementation of metrological sensors beyond the SI. This will be the first step towards quantum-enhanced  measurements  for  metrological  applications.

Five kW Electric Propulsion system for Future European missions in MEO, GEO and beyond	"Electric Propulsion systems based on HET thrusters are now the de facto standard for more than half of the GEO telecommunications and MEO navigation satellites launched each year, with Fakel's SPT-140d model representing the solution until early 2022 baseline for nearly all LSIs worldwide. This is due to its extreme reliability, the long heritage accumulated over the years, and the considerably lower selling price than the few existing competitors (Safran -France-, Aerojet and Busek -USA-). With the outbreak of war in Ukraine, all LSI found themselves in the need to find an alternative to Fakel's Hall effect thruster. As the only product that can be purchased on the western market together with Aerojet Rocketdyne's XR-5, from February 2022 Safran's PPS©5000 became the de facto new incumbent as it is not subject to ITAR restrictions. 

The F4F project aims at developing an alternative system, based on a different thruster, SITAEL’s HT5k, featuring magnetic shielding for very long life operations and able to be fed with both Xenon and Krypton.
The TU will be coupled with an evolution of flight-proven Thales Belgium Mk3 PPU, the Mk3 EVO, and with an European solution for low pressure flow management from the German Company AST.

The three subsystems will be modified to reduce complexity and limit at the bare minimum ITAR/EAR controlled items.

Through a full coupling test, F4F will demonstrate performance at system level with the thruster unit operated with both xenon and krypton, and advance its TRL towards a full qualification.

Fighting childhood obesity to stay healthy all over the life	"Obesity rates in late teens have increased in Europe from 6% in 1980 to 32%, with long-lasting effects on the prevalence of severe obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease, premature death and disability. Efficiently fighting adult obesity is difficult but prevention and treatment of obesity have proven to work better at young ages. OBELISK goal is to cut the roots of the pandemic of obesity in Europe targeting children first. OBELISK is focused on elucidating, Predicting, Preventing obesity and bringing Precision medicine for children with obesity. OBELISK medicine is also Participative (4P), leveraging the potential of social innovation through engagement with families, scientific and medical communities, daycare, schools, municipalities, industries to achieve success.
OBELISK objectives are: 1/ to bring breakthroughs in the molecular mechanisms by which causative factors interact to drive (or prevent) the transition from normal weight to obesity during childhood and to develop and exploit for prevention and treatment early predictive proprietary tools; 2/ to identify at least 3 novel childhood obesity genes with the prospect of identifying additional drug targets; 3/ to demonstrate the utility of targeted approaches to prevent childhood obesity; 4/ to bring breakthroughs in childhood obesity treatment including a real-life clinical study of a promising existing drug (GLP1R agonist) to reverse obesity in people with mutations predisposing to early severe obesity; 5/ to exploit the project results and disseminate best practices to prevent and treat childhood obesity, implementing education programs and translating OBELISK clinical results into guidelines and proposals for policy makers to change obesity care; 6/ to facilitate networking and exchanges with other actions and projects in order to optimize knowledge and joint activities.

Ferrotransmons and Ferrogatemons for Scalable Superconducting Quantum Computers	We propose alternative approaches to superconducting qubit technology. State-of-the-art implementations require flux-bias lines to tune the qubit frequency. These lines are controlled with currents which can damage qubit performance by inducing undesirable magnetic fields. This is detrimental to qubit performance and presents a severe bottleneck for scalability, as these lines are associated with significant heat dissipation. In this project, we advance two novel superconducting qubit designs capable of overcoming this challenge by eliminating the need for flux lines. This will involve the investigation of SIsFS junctions and their integration into quantum processors. One innovation track will implement SIsFS junctions in a transmon geometry—ferrotransmons. The other will hybridize gatemons and π-junction to deliver a ferrogatemon. Three of Europe’s leading quantum startups will integrate these alternative qubit types into prototype full-stack systems to test the implications of these novel approaches on scalability and performance quality.

Ferroelectric PHOtonics ENablIng novel functionalities and enhanced performance of neXt generating PICs	"In PHOENIX, we create the next generation of compact photonic integrated circuits (PIC) offering a continuous and efficient control over optical signals. A barium titanate (BTO) on silicon nitride (SiN) platform will be optimized to enable novel functionalities and produce enhanced PICs. The novel functionalities stem from a combination of materials having a metal-insulator transition with epitaxial ferroelectrics. Vanadium oxides (VOx) deliver a maximum contrast in absorption while Barium Titanate (BTO) offers an efficient and programmable control of the phase of an optical signal through Pockels and photorefractive effects.
The developed technologies will be demonstrated in four uses cases in high-impact emerging applications: 1) fully homomorphic encryption, 2) 5G infrastructure, 3) inference of deep neural networks and 4) training of deep neural networks.
The project has four main objectives: a) to provide novel photonic technologies with enhanced functionalities thanks to the integration of VOx and BTO, b) to provide a BTO/SiN waveguide platform for subsequent manufacturing of PICs and an upgraded version of such a platform integrating VOx with the potential to improve their performance and scalability, c) to build up the demonstrators, and d) to advance in the understanding, realization and upscaling of high-quality oxide thin-films by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) on large area.
The validation of the developed technology will be completed with an extrapolation to benchmark against representative existing systems and a roadmap for photonic-electronic integration.

Fast gated superconducting nanowire camera for multi-functional optical tomograph	Traditionally, monitoring of organs and deep body functional imaging is done by ultrasound, X-Rays (incl CT), PET or MRI. These techniques only allow for very limited measurements of functionality, usually combined with exogenous and radioactive agents. In this project we propose an innovative light sensing solution, a fast gated, ultra-high quantum efficiency single-photon sensor, to enable multi-functional deep body imaging with diffuse optics. The new type of sensor is based on superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors, that have shown to be ultra-fast and highly efficient. However, until now the active area and number of pixels has been limited to micrometers diameter and tens of pixels. We propose the combination of two new readout techniques, optical gating and charge coupling, to overcome this limit and scale to 10,000 pixels and millimeter diameter. In addition we will develop new strategies for performing TD-NIRS and TD-SCOS to use this new light sensor optimally with Monte-Carlo simulations. We will implement  the new light sensor in an optical tomograph and achieve a 100x improvement of SNR compared to using existing light sensors.

Exploring nonclassical states of center-of-mass mechanical motion with superconducting magneto- and levitomechanics	SuperMeQ addresses three basic science goals in quantum technologies, targeting to gain new insights into quantum control  over the center-of-mass motion of mechanical resonators: (i) We will push to the limits of decoherence mechanisms of massive objects, (ii) we will maximize the vacuum coupling of the center-of-mass motion of a mechanical resonator to a quantum system, and (iii) we will generate useful nonclassical states such as squeezed states or states with a negative Wigner function, which have direct relevance for quantum-enhanced force and inertial sensing. Our project follows a unique approach by realizing two complementary experimental platforms that are tailored to our goals and that are mutually beneficial through parallel development: (a) magnetically levitated superconducting microparticles that access a mass regime spanning more than seven orders of magnitude between picogram and sub-milligram masses, and that are expected to exhibit ultra-low mechanical decoherence, and (b) integrated clamped magnetic or superconducting mechanical resonators that are expected to reach strong vacuum coupling rates, two orders of magnitude larger than the state-of-the-art. Key in each of these approaches is that we will couple both types of mechanical resonator inductively to superconducting quantum circuits, which allow for full quantum control over the center-of-mass degree of freedom of the mechanical resonators. Our project results will lead to a breakthrough in the development and growth of novel quantum sensing technologies and give new insights into foundational aspects of quantum physics.	decoherence; massive quantum systems; superconducting quantum circuits; nanomechanical resonators; optomechanics	CHALMERS TEKNISKA HOGSKOLA AB -	BAYERISCHE AKADEMIE DER WISSENSCHAFTEN - BADW; KARLSRUHER INSTITUT FUER TECHNOLOGIE - KIT	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101080143/program/43108390/details	
Exploring Tipping Points and Their Impacts Using Earth System Models	"TipESM brings together scientists from a range of disciplines to deliver a step change in our understanding of climate tipping points in the Earth system, including their impact on ecosystems and society, combined with a set of early warning indicators and safe future emission pathways that minimise the risk of exceeding such tipping points. 

TipESM assembles the latest Earth System Models (ESMs), including recent improvements to key processes: ice sheets, vegetation and land use, permafrost, marine and terrestrial biogeochemistry. In cooperation with the WCRP/Future-Earth project TIPMIP, TipESM will organise an international collaboration to design and realise a common ESM experiment protocol that will facilitate analysis of the likelihood of occurrence, and potential reversibility, of tipping elements at different levels and duration of global warming. These experiments, will be combined with more project-specific ESM experiments, designed to investigate interactions and feedbacks across the Earth system. Based on the TipESM experiments, existing simulations and observations, we will investigate tipping points, their driving processes, potential early warning signals and cascading effects across the climate, ecosystems and society. Including the most important components of the Earth system in our ESMs will also allow TipESM to identify potentially unknown tipping elements, their precursors and impacts.

TipESM brings together expertise from climate science and climate impacts to investigate both the role of gradual climate change for tipping in individual ecosystems and society, and the impact of crossing specific climate tipping points for society, ecosystems, and biodiversity. Project findings will be synthesised into a tipping points risk register.

Exploiting ex vivo expansion and deep multiomics profiling to bring novel, efficient and safer hematopoietic stem cell gene therapies to clinical application	Hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) are an elusive cell type, whose presence can only be inferred retrospectively, from the outcome of time-consuming transplantation experiments. Since current state-of-the-art does not allow prospective HSC identification, today’s cell and gene therapy technology has been mostly optimized on surrogate progenitor cells, which differ biologically from HSC. The technological breakthrough of this proposal is to capture HSC in the ex vivo culture, achieved by a combination of innovative expansion conditions, iterative cell sorting and multiomics single cell profiling. Rapid, quantitative and qualitative in vitro HSC assessment predictive of in vivo function may become a sustainable alternative to mouse xenotransplantation experiments. Applied to a state-of-the-art toolbox of genetic engineering technologies including clinically-proven lentiviral vectors as well as established and emerging targeted genome editing approaches, our in vitro HSC readout sets new standards in terms of throughput and turnaround time, allowing to efficiently test a multitude of HSC engineering conditions and tailor the most suitable technological approach to a specific disease or therapeutic application. This new precision-based approach to ex vivo HSC gene therapy will be applied to inherited bone marrow failure syndromes and cancer as paradigmatic examples where gene therapy may be used to correct a cell-intrinsic genetic defect or turn hematopoietic progeny into therapeutic vehicles provided with novel functions. Bringing together experts in cutting-edge gene editing technologies, ex vivo HSC manipulation, assessment of HSC responses to genetic engineering and bioinformatics analysis & integration of multi-dimensional single cell data will maximize the chances of delivering safer and more effective next-generation HSC-based gene therapy products, extending the reach of gene therapy to new disease contexts and making the outcome after gene therapy more predictable.

Explaining and Predicting the Ocean Conveyor	EPOC will generate a new conceptual framework for the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation, to understand how it functions in the Earth system and impacts weather and climate.  The AMOC is a key component of the climate system, responsible for ocean heat and freshwater transport, associated with the ventilation of anthropogenic carbon, and anticipated to experience or drive climate tipping points.  However, the link between ocean transport, ventilation and tipping points relies on the common conceptual view of the AMOC as a ‘great ocean conveyor’ which was developed to explain very long timescale (glacial-interglacial) fluctuations in climate.  The conveyor-belt schematic conflates millennial timescales with human timescales (days to 100 years), leading to misconceptions by the observing and modelling communities, and misplaced expectations about the AMOC’s role in climate.  EPOC will capitalise on new understanding about the AMOC variability and coherence from two decades of AMOC observations and advances in ocean observing technology and climate modelling, to develop new tools and approaches to quantify and explain past AMOC change and how its connectivity or lack thereof imprint on the Earth system. Through joined-up observational and model experiments, focussing on next generation high resolution coupled models, machine learning techniques and critical re-assessment of paleo proxies, EPOC will generate a new conceptual framework for the AMOC, its meridional connectivity, feedbacks and the relationship between ventilation and overturning on human timescales.  This will lead to better predictions of the AMOC and related climate evolution, including the risk of rapid change.

European iNitiative for Low cost, Innovative and Green High Thrust ENgine - Engine Demonstration	"The space sector is a source of economic growth, jobs and exports, contributing to all Key Strategic Orientations of the EU strategic plan. Faced with growing competition and technological disruption, it is drastically vital to act in support of European space launchers development to preserve European independent access to space.
European launchers must improve their competitiveness by halving launch price in the short term. In the long term, Europe will create common building blocks for an integrated and competitive European family of launchers of all scales with reusability functionalities. 
The purpose of ENLIGHTEN is to develop and test advanced production means and technologies for reusable rocket engines, following on the Prometheus® ESA program, in order to create a family of reusable, high-power engines fueled by bio-methane or green hydrogen.
In the continuity of ENLIGHTEN, ENLIGHTEN-ED aims at maturate enabling technologies, subsystems, tools and processes by bringing them to TRL5/6. Then, ENLIGHTEN-ED will demonstrate the above technologies by engine on-ground demonstration tests by 2026 to reach TRL7.
In the frame of ENLIGHTEN-ED, a tailored consortium (including major aerospace actors, SME, RTO and an university) will prepare a demonstrator of green high thrust engine (GTHE) based on liquid hydrogen using:
- The latest advances in additive manufacturing to reduce the cost and number of engine parts,
- Artificial Intelligence and machine learning to develop the first space engine health Monitoring System in Europe necessary to implement reusability,
- New ultra-low-cost subsystems as engine ignition system, nozzle extension, electric valves and multi-functional lines.
Therefore, ENLIGHTEN-ED will demonstrate the ability of such an ultra-low-cost engine to be rapidly operational and available for all European launcher families and thus strive to increase the competitiveness of European GTHE."	space propulsion; hydrogen; green high-thrust engines; green hydrogen; Additive manufacturing; AI; demonstration; test platform; health monitoring; reusability	ARIANEGROUP SAS - ARIANEGROUP SAS	AEROSPACE PROPULSION PRODUCTS; AIKO SRL - AIKO	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101135156/program/43108390/details	
European Lighthouse on Secure and Safe AI	In order to reinforce European leadership in safe and secure AI technology, we are proposing a virtual center of excellence on safe and secure AI that will address major challenges hampering the deployment of AI technology. These grand challenges are fundamental in nature. Addressing them in a sustainable manner requires a lighthouse rooted in scientific excellence and rigorous methods. We will develop a strategic research agenda which is supported by research programmes that focus on “technical robustness and safety”, “privacy preserving techniques and infrastructures” and “human agency and oversight”. Furthermore, we focus our efforts to detect, prevent and mitigate threats and enable recovery from harm by 3 grand challenges: “Robustness guarantees and certification”, “Private and robust collaborative learning at scale” and “Human-in-the-loop decision making: Integrated governance to ensure meaningful oversight” that cut across 6 use cases: health, autonomous driving, robotics, cybersecurity, multi-media, and document intelligence. Throughout our project, we seek to integrate robust technical approaches with legal and ethical principles supported by meaningful and effective governance architectures to nurture and sustain the development and deployment of AI technology that serves and promotes foundational European values. Our initiative builds on and expands the internationally recognized, highly successful and fully operational network of excellence ELLIS (European Laboratory for Learning and Intelligent Systems). We build ELSA on its 3 pillars: research programmes, a set of research units, and a PhD/postdoc programme, thereby connecting a network of over 100 organizations and more than 337 ELLIS fellows and scholars (113 ERC grants) committed to shared standards of excellence. We will not only establish a virtual center of excellence, but all our activities will be also inclusive and open to input, interactions and collaboration of AI researchers and industrial partners in order to drive the entire field forward.

European Eddy-RIch ESMs	"Eddy Rich Earth System Models (EERIE) will develop a new generation of Earth System Models (ESMs) that are capable of explicitly representing a crucially important, yet unexplored regime of the Earth system, the ocean mesoscale. Leveraging the latest advances in science and technology, EERIE will substantially improve the ability of such ESMs to faithfully represent the centennial-scale evolution of the global climate, especially its variability, extremes and how tipping points may unfold under the influence of the ocean mesoscale. Model improvements include new dynamical cores, new components (particularly sea ice), scale-aware parametrization and the complementary use of Machine Learning (ML) 
The technological challenge associated with this ambition is very high. EERIE’s goal is to achieve a simulation speed of up to 5 simulated years per day (5 SYPDs) and to make efficient use (reduction in power consumption by 50%) of the pre-exascale supercomputers now available in Europe. The technological solutions that are to be leveraged in EERIE are the use of reduced precision, GPUs, ML and reduced I/O. Alongside model improvements, EERIE will develop innovative experimental simulation protocols that are suitable for the mesoscale, to be pioneered on behalf of the global climate modelling community, in preparation for the next IPCC. 
EERIE will produce useful and usable climate information that will contribute to national and international climate change assessments such as IPCC; it will incorporate model variability and extremes within an Integrated Assessment Model (IAM) via a MLemulato;, and it will deliver storyline approaches to the consequences of climate tipping points and disease outbreaks."

European Clinical Research Alliance on Infectious Diseases - PRIMary care adaptive platform trial for pandemics and Epidemics	"European citizens affected by COVID-19 have been well-served by landmark clinical trials in hospitals that have found treatments that save many lives. However, there are fewer opportunities for people in the community to contribute to the urgent mission of finding treatments that speed recovery, and reduce the need for hospital admission in the first place. Evidence-based therapeutics for use in primary care have the potential for considerable reach and impact on individual suffering and functioning, as well as on the sustainability of health services. ECRAID-Prime, a European Adaptive Platform Trial (APT) of therapeutics for patients with COVID-19 and potentially COVID-like illness in primary care will build on many years of EU investment in infrastructure for primary care trials and a mature primary care research network that has pioneered novel, efficient, platform clinical trial designs. In the winter of 2022/23, respiratory viruses will be co-circulating and disease aetiology can’t be distinguished solely on clinical grounds. Treatments with potentially broad antiviral activity will be most beneficial if started early in the disease trajectory. For those treatments patients with syndromic COVID-like-illness might be included.

ECRAID-Prime, with a focus on early phase studies of safety and efficacy of exciting candidate treatments for COVID-19 and COVID-like illness will be rapidly set up. Its goal is to test at least four candidate treatments, identifying suitability for inclusion in the next phases of research, and so leading to critical additions to the primary care therapeutic armamentarium against COVID-19 and COVID-like illness. ECRAID-Prime will additionally help complete the vison for a lasting, integrated, comprehensive and sustainable European clinical research preparedness and response capacity, Ecraid, that will provide a full, integrated suite of international priority clinical trials in intensive care units, hospital wards, and now in primary care as well."

European Bench for Engine and Stage Testing	"In 2030, there will be several private small launchers in activity in Europe, with a higher launch rate than A6 and Vega C. 
99.99% of the launcher life is spent on the ground, the flight period is a tiny part of his life. With launcher reusability the major factor of cost for space transportation will be the ground segment CAPEX and OPEX. Among ground activities, there will be hundreds of engines and stages tests per year, covering all the launcher life cycle phases : qualification, production, reuse.
Our consortium think there is a place for a new business model where standardized ground segment services are sold to launchers, in place of letting them invest and operate their own specific facilities, which represent a high cost.

To do so, we propose to work on two main axis: horizontality and verticality. Horizontally means that our solutions allow, for a given launcher, to have equivalent user experiences and services for all life cycle needs, thanks to mobile and modular ground means.  Vertical interoperability means that our solutions allow, for a given location and life phase, to propose an equivalent experience and service for different launchers. 

Several such interoperable facilities may be exploited across Europe and even worldwide. Europe is then capable to become a leader of interoperability implementation, it is of prime importance for future space exploration and exploitation where interoperability is a key.
The Eu-BEST will be used to
- test rocket engines from different manufacturers
- test rocket stages from different manufacturers

The targeted performances are:
- up to 500kN
-200 tests per year
- 25k€ per test

Such engine testing facility doesn’t exist in the world. It will significantly strengthen European space transportation capabilities and put Europe at the forefront of ground technologies for launchers.
To achieve those functional and performances targets, Eu-BEST concept relies on interoperability, modularity, and virtual commissioning."

Ethical Design of Holography with Dense wireless Networks	"Ubiquitous perception, by sensing of objects, subjects and gestures, is a pivotal challenge for future technology: it enables personalized services such as smart living, automated logistics or interaction through free-space gestures. However, it also challenges ethical and moral boundaries and threatens privacy. HOLDEN proposes a radically new approach to perception by concisely analysing ethical constraints and privacy risks while re-thinking RF-based sensing. We establish necessary conditions for privacy preserving and ethically compliant sensing and develop new paradigms respecting these constraints.
For the first time ever, HOLDEN constitutes a concentrated effort to explore social aspects of RF-sensing to guide the technological advance and to derive technology for ethically and privacy compliant perception. Central to HOLDEN is the development of ethical and privacy constraints. We use these findings to derive privacy and ethically compliant concepts for RF-based perception. We will develop a system of distributed multi-antenna devices for simultaneous multi-target recognition and ubiquitous perception with unprecedented accuracy, which constitutes a radical paradigm shift from a technology-centric perspective to a privacy-centric one via privacy by design. HOLDEN achieves this goal along three high risk, complementary, and privacy-centric paths:
Path 1: Continuous-space measurement points: Radio-based 3D vision by holographic image processing of RF wave-fronts.
Path 2: Discrete-space measurement points: Advanced 3D beamforming for human-scale recognition and tracking through dense massive connected antenna arrays. Path 3: Signal processing and learning: High-dimensional tensor processing for the distinction of complex activities and motion from massive-dimensional RF data. The resulting breakthrough approaches and algorithms will be compared against application-level benchmarks via usage scenarios in the fields of logistics, smart living, and free-space "	Ethics in ICT; Philosophy of technology; RF-holography; Radio vision; Device-free; Ethical and Privacy implications, Responsible design; network sensing in massive MIMO	AALTO KORKEAKOULUSAATIO SR - AALTO	ADANT SRL - Adant; CONSIGLIO NAZIONALE DELLE RICERCHE - CNR	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101099491/program/43108390/details	
Energy Storage in Molecules	ESiM will create the scientific basis for a radically new technology addressing the pressing challenges of scalable clean energy storage. The ESiM strategy is to use the conformational degrees of freedom of organic molecules, and to create dense molecular arrays of scalable dimensions on a surface to avoid the limits of battery technology based on ions flow and on environmentally harmful substances. ESiM will provide the proof of principle that storing energy in molecules is feasible, constructing laboratory devices and validating the scientific and technological basis for novel energy storage devices. ESiM will produce scientific and technological achievements well beyond the fields of the individual partners, involving chemistry, physics, and simulation tools. The added value of our interdisciplinary approach will enable the development of methods and materials for an efficient storage of energy in specific degrees of freedom of organic molecules on a supporting surface, ultimately leading to an environmentally friendly, recyclable way of producing, storing, and using energy. Molecules will be designed and synthesized to first capture a possible deviation from the micro-reversibility principle and demonstrate energy pumping and storing in a few specific intramolecular mechanical degrees of freedom. Then, 2D molecular layers will be developed to efficiently store this energy using electric fields and inelastic electrons as a second energy source. As a proof of principle, ESiM will produce a device based on a bimetallic cantilever to store and release energy from the active molecules. ESiM will maintain close contact with industry via regular meetings (ESiM-Industry days) involving nanotechnology startups, energy providers and high-tech SMEs, to favour exchange and synergy towards the identification of innovative potential technology transfer. ESiM will use public talks, scientific workshops, and scientific publications to reach the broadest possible audience.	scanning tunneling microscopy; surface science; single molecule actuator (rotor; switch); molecular synthesis; energy storage	TECHNISCHE UNIVERSITAET DRESDEN - TUD	AGENCIA ESTATAL CONSEJO SUPERIOR DE INVESTIGACIONES CIENTIFICAS - CSIC; CENTRE NATIONAL DE LA RECHERCHE SCIENTIFIQUE CNRS - CNRS	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101046364/program/43108390/details	
Energetic Solar Eruptions: Data and Analysis Tools	"The SOLER project will investigate energetic solar eruptions starting from three perspectives: fast coronal mass ejections (CMEs), strong X-ray flares, and large solar energetic particle (SEP) events. Key parameters of the eruptions will be determined and their interrelations examined to improve our understanding on how the eruptive phenomena are linked, how they interact with each other, and how they result in acceleration of high energy particles and their release from the solar corona into interplanetary space. Large-amplitude coronal waves and shocks related to these events as well as magnetic connections of the radiation sources with the in-situ observers will be in focus as well.

SOLER will answer three science questions:
– What are the magnetic connections between EM radiation sources in the low corona and in the high corona and how are they connected to the particle radiation observed in situ?
– What is the relation of the properties of the in-situ SEP observations with the source characteristics and between the source characteristics themselves? 
– What are the reasons for the large variations in SEP properties and associated flare and CME characteristics?
Related to these scientific questions, SOLER has also technical objectives. SOLER will:
– deliver interlinked catalogues of strong flares, fast CMEs and large SEP events.
– deliver new tools for analysing and visualising solar eruption datasets and modelling results and distribute them openly to the scientific community.
– produce several high-level multi-instrument datasets and distribute them openly to the scientific community.

SOLER will use ESA, NASA and national mission data along with ground-based observations, and a variety of innovative data and image processing techniques together with cutting-edge models. SOLER analysis activities will directly lead to dozens of scientific publications. Catalogues, datasets and tools will be openly available for the community for further exploitation of data."

Endoscopic brush cytology and single cell clinal dynamics of early easophageal adenocarcinoma for detecting cost effective surveillance strategies and prediction of cancer recurrence	In many European countries the recent rise in incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) is without precedent.  EAC is notorious for its highly aggressive biological behavior leading to invasive disease and early metastases. The only way to reduce mortality is through treatment in early stage of the cancer. EAC has a well recognized premalignant precursor lesion identified as esophageal metaplasia, or Barrett’s Esophagus (BE), which offers important opportunities for treatment in early stages of cancer which may reach 5 years survival rates up to 80%. However, these patients need to be monitored constantly for timely intervention in case of disease recurrence or metastases. The problem is that after endoscopic treatment up to 30% of cases will develop recurring cancers or even present with metastases, which requires additional endoscopic treatments or surgery. Currently it is impossible to predict which of the treated BE patients with  will have stable disease and which will recur or progress to invasive cancer. As a consequence all treated patients need to remain in frequent endoscopic surveillance. This leads to over-treatment of a large group of BE patients and under-treatment of those with more aggressive disease. There is a low cost effectiveness of endoscopic therapies, low quality of life of patients and poor satisfaction of care providers. An accurate risk stratification method for early AEC in BE patients is therefore an unmet clinical need. The ambition of the ENDEAVOR  consortium is to implement an innovative risk stratification method, which encompasses minimally invasive cell collection supplemented by single cell genomic analysis to address this specific need. Taking into account patient characteristics, gender dimensions, an optimal model model will be tested in a randomized controlled prospective trial. Future implementation of this method will reduce health care costs, increase quality of life and satisfaction of health care providers. This action is part of the Cancer Mission cluster of projects on Diagnostics and Treatment (diagnostics).

Enabling environments for NCD risk reduction in Ethiopia	To improve the health outcomes of its citizens, Ethiopia must take steps to meet SDG3.4 and decrease the number of premature deaths caused by non-communicable diseases (NCDs). NCD deaths are preventable by tackling their risk factors: unhealthy diets, physical inactivity, and air pollution. These risk factors are becoming increasingly prevalent in urban sites and have their origins in fetal life, and focusing prevention policies on pregnancy can yield significant benefits. Pregnancy is a unique opportunity for lifestyle interventions and antenatal care (ANC) has long been a key strategy for health promotion, disease prevention, early diagnosis, and treatment. The high ANC coverage in urban Ethiopia makes it an ideal program to support access and utilization of quality NCD services for prevention and risk reduction in urban populations. Guided by the immediate need for high-quality implementation research and evaluations in real-word settings to tackle the multisectoral and complex challenges of NCD prevention, we will fill the implementation knowledge gaps by developing, implementing, and assessing the impact of a novel prevention program in four diverse urban sites. We will apply user-centered approaches to adapt effective evidence-based WHO guidelines and implementation strategies with beneficiaries and stakeholders. Our approach for achieving behavior change in pregnant women is twofold: i) thorough assessments of women’s environments and environmental risks, as wider determinants of health; ii) integration of implementation strategies into the National Health Information system of Ethiopia. We will provide real-word evidence for the impact of implementation for behavior change, NCD risk reduction and better maternal and child health. ENABLE will support care providers for continuity and quality of overall healthcare and of NCD care and surveillance, and ultimately strengthen the Ethiopian public health system towards better health for all. 	environmental health; air pollution; physical activity; nutrition; implementation science; intervention science; lifecourse epidemiology; maternal health	FOLKEHELSEINSTITUTTET - NORWEGIAN INSTITUTE OF PUBLIC HEALTH NIPH	ADDIS CONTINENTAL ENTREPRENEURS PLC - ACE; ETHIOPIAN PUBLIC HEALTH INSTITUTE - EPHI	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101137232/program/43108390/details	
Enabling advances in diagnosis, patient stratification and treatment for dilated cardiomyopathy patients and families.	"Dilated Cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a heart muscle disorder characterised by thinning and stretching of the heart ventricles, making it harder for the heart to pump blood (systolic dysfunction). This disorder, with an estimated prevalence of up to 1/250, predominantly affects younger adults. It is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, including heart failure and sudden cardiac death, with end-stage DCM being the leading indication for heart transplantation.

The current disease burden in DCM is largely attributable to two important gaps in scientific knowledge: Firstly, our understanding of the aetiology and genetic architecture of DCM remains limited, hindering the utility of genetic testing in clinical patient management. Secondly, there are limited therapeutic options for DCM patients. Existing therapies are generic and target symptoms. No curative treatments exist, apart from invasive heart transplantation and there are no approved therapies targeting underlying molecular disease mechanisms. 

A fuller understanding of the genetic architecture of DCM and knowledge of the genes and genetic variants involved are critically needed to provide solutions for these unmet medical needs.

The DCM-NEXT consortium combines world-leading interdisciplinary expertise and resources of 8 investigators in the fields of DCM, deep clinical phenotyping, cardiogenomics, cardiac transcriptomics, artificial intelligence, in silico drug target discovery and functional studies. They will uniquely leverage their unparalleled cohort of 11,750 DCM probands and relatives with extensive clinical and omics data.

Through cutting-edge genomic and cardiac transcriptomic studies, the project aims to (1) revolutionise genetic testing and patient stratification for more precise prediction of disease onset, progression and risk of major adverse cardiac events; and (2) accelerate development of novel therapies by identifying and validating targets involved in pathogenesis of DCM."

Emergent awareness from minimal collectives	Awareness in biological agents has converging definitions when considering local states describing content-related consciousness from an agent-specific perspective. However, it becomes highly debated when it comes to global states. The issue magnifies when considering collectives of artificial agents. Several frameworks exist, all unsatisfactory in the limitations posed to agents’ heterogeneity and disappearance of the local self into an integrated state. Ultimately, existing frameworks are ineffective in explaining, facilitating, and supporting cooperative behaviours in artificial agents. The lack of a compelling theory of global awareness in AI is currently a significant barrier to the effective deployment of artificial agents in the real world. EMERGE tackles this grand challenge by introducing the novel concept of collaborative awareness for collectives of minimal artificial beings. We will investigate how simple agents can develop a representation of their mutual existence, environment, and cooperative behaviour towards the realization of tasks and goals. EMERGE builds on a scenario of artificial beings with no shared language and constrained individual capabilities, which nevertheless leads to high-complexity behaviours at the collective level. Collaborative awareness becomes an emergent process supporting complex, distributed, and loosely coupled systems capable of high degrees of collaboration, self-regulation, and interoperability without pre-defined protocols. EMERGE delivers a philosophical, mathematical, and technological framework that enables us to know how and where to allocate awareness to achieve a goal through the collective optimally. We will demonstrate EMERGE concepts on robotic use cases, with hints of broader applicability of the framework to Internet of Things, pervasive computing, nanotechnologies. We will also investigate the ethical implications of collaborative awareness, focusing on moral responsibility, vulnerabilities, and trust.

Electrocatalytic Production of liquid Organic hydrogen carrier and CHemicals from lignin	"EPOCH proposes to develop a novel approach in linking green hydrogen production with the direct loading of liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHC) enabling a transformative logistic of green hydrogen distribution and storage. Lignin derivatives are used to be selectively oxidized. Compared to water electrolysis, EPOCH will advance the field by (1) using the nascent hydrogen at the cathode directly to load LOHCs allowing economic H2 storage and transport, and (2) converting at the anode waste lignin and its derivatives via selective oxidation. EPOCH is beyond the state-of-the-art solutions, as it does not form molecular H2 at the cathode nor generates oxygen at the anode. By modifying both cathodic and anodic reactions, EPOCH reduces the energy intensity.
 
EPOCH will enable better cell performance and enhanced added-value device operations by (i) improving energy efficiency, (ii) allowing cost reductions, and (iii) intensifying the process. The EPOCH device will be designed for flexible integration with biorefineries and pulp & paper industries, to valorize their lignin waste streams, thus, linking these industrial sectors and H2 economy. EPOCH will allow the production of green H2 in areas where renewable energy production (in the energy mix) is higher. Therefore, EPOCH will offer a new path to effectively decrease the carbon footprint of energy-intensive industries.

Development of the novel EPOCH electrocatalytic device requires (a) advanced components (electrocatalysts, electrodes, electrolytes and ionic liquid promoters, membranes) and (b) validation of the full module cell operation at laboratory scale. Thus, our project integrates multidisciplinary top-experts in areas such as electrocatalysis, lignin chemistry, and materials synthesis, with a large engineering company on energy transition and a SME world-leading the LOHC technology development and logistic."

Electrobiocatalytic cascade for bulk reduction of CO2 to CO coupled to fermentative production of high value diamine monomers	The access to platform chemicals made of CO2 and nitrogen sources as starting materials via sustainable processes requires radical innovations. Driven by the global need of existing and growing markets, combined technologies that make use of renewable energy and the greenhouse gas CO2, and the use of nature’s catalysts such as enzymes and microbial cells through biotransformation steps are expected to have a game changing impact. Such catalysts can operate at ambient conditions at high atom efficiency through environmentally and energetically friendly processes. In this context ECOMO unites bioelectrocatalysis, biohybrid materials sciences, organic synthesis, technical microbiology, and process engineering for CO gas fermentation to acetate and a subsequent production of diamines. The fermentation steps will be achieved by specifically engineered microbial strains using CO as both the carbon source and energy carrier. As core novelty, the CO will be produced in situ apart from the electrode in the bulk solution from CO2 through a mediated electron transfer to free floating beads where CO-dehydrogenase is immobilized within the acetate forming bacterial cell culture. This will enable for the first time, full compatibility between electrochemical and biocatalytic processes. The synthetic aim is to yield high value-added diamine monomers as building blocks for established classes of polymeric materials. ECOMO will establish new bio based and biohybrid modules that will be directly compatible with the existing bioreactor infrastructure for the producing of specialty chemicals directly from CO2. By achieving the production of diamines as a proof-of-concept, ECOMO will foster further diversification to many other products made from CO2 and thus enhances the synthetic availability of needed building blocks for the chemical industry. The decoupling from fossil-sourced energy and raw materials underpin the timeliness of ECOMO.

Efficient Verification of Quantum computing architectures with Bosons	"Quantum devices offer great promise for computation, cryptography, communication, and sensing. Alternative approaches to quantum information processing in which bosonic modes are the carriers of information have attracted increasing attention, because they offer a hardware-efficient path to fault-tolerance and scalability thanks to their inherently large Hilbert space. 
However, this poses the problem of providing rigorous guarantees of the correct functioning of these promising bosonic architectures, a task known as quantum verification. To date, this verification is performed by general-purpose tomographic techniques, which rapidly become intractable for large quantum systems. Thus, other methods are needed as quantum devices are scaled up to achieve real-world advantages.

VeriQuB will introduce a new approach to the verification of quantum computing architectures with bosons based on continuous-variable measurements. VeriQuB’s technological toolbox will comprise two main elements.
(i) We will experimentally demonstrate the verification of multi-mode bosonic systems for optical and superconducting architectures well beyond the state-of-the-art, and provide the first demonstration of verified quantum computational speedup.
(ii) We will develop a theory framework that defines the fundamental advantages of our contribution, putting special emphasis on identifying and verifying resourceful bosonic quantum devices.

The VeriQuB consortium comprises world leading scientific partners who are ideally positioned to achieve the ambitious vision of this project and build a state-of-the-art verification technology toolbox, enabling bosonic quantum computing architectures to scale up, and positioning Europe as a leader in this domain."

Efficient QUantum ALgorithms for IndusTrY	A quantum revolution is unfolding, and European scientists are on the lead. Now, it is time to take decisive action and transform our scientific potential into a competitive advantage. Achieving this goal will be critical to ensuring Europe’s technological sovereignty in the coming decades. EQUALITY brings together scientists, innovators, and prominent industrial players with the mission of developing cutting-edge quantum algorithms to solve strategic industrial problems. The consortium will develop a set of algorithmic primitives which could be used as modules for various industry-specific workflows. These primitives include differential equation solvers, material simulation algorithms, quantum optimisers, etc. To focus our efforts, we target eight paradigmatic industrial problems. These problems are likely to yield to early quantum advantage and pertain to the aerospace and energy storage industries. They include airfoil aerodynamics, battery and fuel cell design, space mission optimisation, etc. Our goal is to develop quantum algorithms for real industrial problems using real quantum hardware. This requires grappling with the limitations of present-day quantum hardware. Thus, we will devote a large portion of our efforts to developing strategies for optimal hardware exploitation. These low-level implementations will account for the effects of noise and topology and will optimise algorithms to run on limited hardware. EQUALITY will build synergies with Quantum Flagship projects and Europe’s thriving ecosystem of quantum start-ups. Use cases will be tested on quantum hardware from three of Europe’s leading vendors and two HPC centres. The applications targeted have the potential of creating billions of euros for end-users and technology providers over the coming decades. With EQUALITY, we aim at playing a role in unlocking this value and placing Europe at the centre of this development. The project gathers 9 partners and has a budget of €6M over 3 years.

Ecosystem for rapid adoption of modelling and simulation METhods to address regulatory needs in the development of orphan and paediatric medicines 	"ERAMET will provide an integrated approach for developers and regulators’ decision-making for paediatric and orphan drugs, centred on the drug development questions. This will constitute a transparent ecosystem for drug development and assessment, that will facilitate the adoption of modelling and simulation (M&S) methods and related data types (including real word data such as registries and electronic healthcare data).
The overall objective of ERAMET is to provide and implement a framework for establishing the credibility of M&S methods and related results as sources of evidence within regulatory procedures.
The ecosystem proposed by ERAMET will be based on three pillars: 
(1) A repository connecting questions, data and methods.
(2) The development and validation of high-quality standards for data and analytical methods (including M&S and hybrid approaches). These will cover computational M&S, digital twins, AI, hybrid approaches, standard statistics and pharmacometrics, as analytical methods and alternative data types and sources such as RWD, eHealth data, registries, historical regulatory submissions, scientific and (non)clinical trials). 
(3) An AI-based platform that will automate and optimise the data collection, formatting and modelling and simulation analysis and implement the credibility assessment. 
As part of ERAMET, the ecosystem will be applied to five use-cases including paediatric extrapolation and characterisation of drug benefit/risk in 4 groups of rare diseases, namely ataxia, transfusion dependent haemoglobinopathies, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and degenerative neuromuscular.
Each of the use-case is planned to lead to submission and regulatory approval of at least one validated M&S tool via the EMA qualification procedure.  
Training will be proposed to familiarise regulatory assessors, drug developers and clinical researchers with this new approach."	regulatory; drug development; modelling and simulation methods; standards; ecosystem; orphan and paediatric medicines	UNIVERSITE DE NAMUR ASBL - UNamur	ACADEMISCH ZIEKENHUIS GRONINGEN - UNIVERSITAIR MEDISCH CENTRUM GRONINGEN; AGENCE NATIONALE DE SECURITE DU MEDICAMENT ET DES PRODUITS DE SANTE - ANSM	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101137141/program/43108390/details	
Ecology and biology of HPAIV H5 (Kappa-Flu)	The global emergence of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses and the subsequent adaptation to wild birds has resulted in record mortality of wild birds and poultry and is developing into an enzootic threat for wildlife, poultry and human health in Europe. The ongoing evolution of HPAI viruses is expanding their geographical distribution and host range. To deal with this global problem, KAPPA-FLU brings together top experts from Europe, North America and Asia. The overall objective of KAPPA-FLU is the characterization of key viral, host-related and environmental factors that determine the maintenance and the long-distance spread of HPAI viruses in wild birds, with the goal of improving capacities for risk-based surveillance, prevention and control of HPAI in poultry and wildlife, and its potential impact on human health. KAPPA-FLU will follow three research themes. Theme A (Disease ecology) provides a deep understanding of the population dynamics of HPAI viruses in migratory waterbirds and spill-over hosts, both resident wildlife and poultry, through risk-based surveillance strategies, and accounting for the impact of climate change. Theme B (Virology) studies the evolution of HPAI viruses in wild birds and poultry and the resulting increasing risk to humans and other mammals. Based on the above results, theme C (Agro-ecosystem risk) identifies and models prevention and control strategies (including vaccination) using machine learning algorithms. Actors from different sectors of society will, through the Multi-Actor Panel, play key roles in translating results into policy and practice. In this way, KAPPA-FLU will make stepwise advances in knowledge of the population dynamics and evolution of HPAI, and thus contribute to a sustainable poultry production system and improved public health.	highly pathogenic avian influenza; surveillance; virology; wild birds; poultry welfare; mammalian health; spill-over; environment; food safety; agro-ecosystem; risk assessment; control strategies	FRIEDRICH LOEFFLER INSTITUT - BUNDESFORSCHUNGSINSTITUT FUER TIERGESUNDHEIT - FLI	ERASMUS UNIVERSITAIR MEDISCH CENTRUM ROTTERDAM - ERASMUS MC; ISTITUTO ZOOPROFILATTICO SPERIMENTALE DELLE VENEZIE - IZSVE	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101084171/program/43108390/details	
Early identification and remediation of literacy, numeracy, and social-emotional difficulties in kindergarten: an examination of the efficacy of a multi-tiered system of support (MTSS)	Quality education for all is one of the EU’s top priorities. However, several European education systems are regularly pointed out as being underperforming, inequitable or segregated. The core objective of the 4-year MTSS-K project is to adapt, implement and assess the effectiveness and efficiency of a promising American educational approach for kindergarten in five European countries. The so-called Multi-Tiered System of Support (MTSS) aims at reducing inequalities by training teachers to improve the socio-emotional, literacy and numeracy skills of all students and more particularly of the most vulnerable ones. This model calls to adopt evidence-based teaching practices and to regularly and monitor students’ progress on the basis of objective data (Tier 1); to provide early and more intensive group interventions to students who do not progress as expected (Tier 2); and to provide even more intensive interventions to students who continue to need it (Tier 3). This model has been shown to improve equal opportunities of school success and inclusion by significantly diminishing the number of students with learning and behavior difficulties and referred to special education services. However, data is missing as regards comprehensive implementation of this model, its efficacy in kindergarten, its applicability in the European educative systems, and the cost-benefit ratio of this measure. In addition to fill these gaps, the MTSS-K project also aims at making accessible for stakeholders, schools and teachers on a dedicated free-access website evidence-based syntheses, intervention tools, and skills’ assessment instruments developed for the study, to disseminate the results and data in the perspective of the open-science framework, and to make policy recommendations for EU and national authorities. 	multi-tiered system of support; literacy; numeracy; and social-emotional difficulties	UNIVERSITE DU LUXEMBOURG - uni.lu		https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101132586/program/43108390/details	
Early Interception of Inflammatory-mediated Type 2 Diabetes	"The overall concept of INTERCEPT-T2D is to establish whether an inflammatory-mediated profile contributes to the onset of Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) complications, thus enabling the identification of patients most at risk of complications and the design of personalized prevention measures.

T2D is a heterogeneous disease, which is an obstacle to the delivery of an optimal tailored treatment. Consequently, patients’ individual trajectories of progressive hyperglycemia and risk of chronic complications are so far difficult to predict. In this context, onset of diabetic complications represents the most important transitional phase of T2D development toward premature disability and mortality. 

Chronic systemic inflammation has been suggested to be a major contributor to the onset and progression of T2D complications. INTERCEPT-T2D will bring a new and clinically relevant dimension in T2D care considering at diagnosis inflammatory parameters that are of importance for the transition to T2D-related complications. The combination of state-of-the-art genomics and cell-biology technologies with targeted clinical interventions should lead to potent patients’ stratification. It should allow the identification and prognosis of a novel class or subclass of patients characterized by an “Inflammatory-mediated T2D” endotype. 

The project has access to the best-documented longitudinal human European cohorts of patients with T2D, with reliable clinical and biological data allowing to trace the transition and evolution towards organ complications. This, added to the exploitation of an extensive health data warehouse, will enable us to establish the inflammatory trajectory of citizens with T2D from diagnosis to the development of complications. 

To explore the ability to prevent the transition phase of T2D towards organ complications, INTERCEPT-T2D will conduct a phase II clinical trial with an anti-inflammatory therapy targeting NLRP3 Inflammasome activity in patients with T2D.

EU-China joint action to increase development and adoption of IPM tools	The continuous stream of invasive agricultural pests and chronic re-emergence of key ones prompt for implementation of Integrated Pest Management (IPM) tools, but often main management methods rely largely on chemical pesticides. However, their widespread use is highlighted as a key threat to human health and wildlife. Much progress made in the conception of IPM tools in the past decade however, despite EU and Chinese policies prompting use of IPM, widespread adoption by farmers is slowed down by key barriers, notably because many available non-chemical IPM tools (a) have not been optimized (lack reliability or effectiveness), (b) are sub-optimal when combined together in IPM packages as not developed via an integrated approach, and (c) are missing for particular key pests. In this context the project will exploit the thorough knowledge accumulated on pest management methods to adapt and optimize IPM tools and practices which did not reach the field/market yet, or that are currently not efficient enough. In addition, ADOPT-IPM will work on the further development of high potential IPM tools, and will design optimized cost-effective environment-sound IPM packages. The choice of crops and pests in ADOPT-IPM (tomato, leafy vegetables, wheat, and maize) is based on their economic importance in Europe and China and for their current pest management methods relying largely on chemical pesticides. The project is structured in 3 R&D WPs, one for field demonstrations, one for dissemination and one for project management. The consortium has been selected to integrate early in the research process the main end-users of the project’s results (farmers associations, SMEs and key stakeholders). The EU-China consortium also has a strong coverage of experts (and based on many long-term collaborations), to take advantage of the experience of each region and to more efficiently adapt the IPM tools, practices and packages to the specific problems of European and Chinese farmers.	predator; parasitoid; biopesticide; stripcropping; RNAi; banker plant; compost; biostimulant; push-pull; tomato; maize; wheat; leafy vegetable; aphid; disease; lepidoptera; mealybug; thrips; weed	INSTITUT NATIONAL DE RECHERCHE POUR L'AGRICULTURE, L'ALIMENTATION ET L'ENVIRONNEMENT - INRAE	AARHUS UNIVERSITET - AU; ACTA ASSOCIATION DE COORDINATION TECHNIQUE AGRICOLE - LES INSTITUTS TECHNIQUES AGRICOLES - ACTA	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101060430/program/43108390/details	
EU-Africa Concerted Action on SAR-CoV-2 Virus Variant and Immunological Surveillance	Despite of the successful advances achieved to date in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic with the development of vaccines and therapy, the worldwide propagation of SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in the rapid evolution of this virus and in the emergence of variants of concern (VOC) that may dampen the efficacy of the first generation vaccines.  To tackle the challenges associated with the VOC, the CoVICIS program is proposing a global approach with a powerful state-of-the-art virologic and immunologic platforms coupled with large genomic surveillance studies and diverse cohorts in EU and SSA. This allows CoVICIS to contribute to the early identification of emerging VOC and address key unanswered questions regarding i) the susceptibility to infection with VOC after a prior infection in the setting of a long-COVID or after vaccination with different vaccines, ii) the risk posed by VOC in immunocompromised patients, and iii) the modalities of infection and immune responses in children. The diversity of the cohorts provides a unique opportunity to study virus evolution in different settings, where SARS-CoV-2-specific humoral and cellular immune responses are predicted to vary very significantly. Beyond the genomic surveillance, the ground-breaking research and innovation of the program is the characterization of virologic and immunologic properties of VOC and the identification of immune correlates of protection after disease or vaccination. CoVICIS’ ambitious goals are only achievable thanks to the existing population studies and cohorts funded by national and international public agencies and public-private partnerships, and the combined collective expertise of CoVICIS partners in the fields of epidemiology, genomics, virology, immunology, data science and public health.

EU-AU PARTNERSHIP FOR RESILIENT, INCLUSIVE AND SAFE FOOD SYSTEMS FOR EVERYONE	"The UP-RISE EU-African Union (AU) project integrates food safety practices associated to mycotoxin contamination into all aspects of food production, distribution, marketing and consumption in the AU and provides tangible tools and strategies to enhance inclusive participation in the improved African Food Safety System (AFSS) at the local, national and regional level. UP-RISE activities are aligned with the current AU Food Safety Strategy for Africa, focusing on 3 regions of the AU with field work in 5 target member states (Benin, Côte d’Ivoire, Nigeria, Kenya, and South-Africa).
UP-RISE assembles 5 building blocks for knowledge generation and implementation: 1) Roadmaps for a shared quality culture and possible integration of the informal sector in the AFSS; 2) Strengthening the food safety regulatory framework with focus on mycotoxins in both formal and informal sectors; 3) Early warning to prevent mycotoxin contamination and adapt to climate change; 4) Prevention of food losses and improving food safety by providing innovative microbiome-based solutions for mycotoxin reduction and nutritious food and 5) Co-creation, training and mentoring. UP-RISEs co-created solutions will be demonstrated on 5 representative fermented food product value chains based on maize, millet, sorghum or milk and will be implemented in 10 business cases of SMEs in the target AU member states.
UP-RISE builds on strong synergies between all excelling consortium members combining social sciences with technological approaches and an outstanding network, which has been complemented with the Accelerator Platform comprising a.o. competent food safety authorities, farmers, consumers and trade organizations.
UP-RISE guarantees sustainability through the creation of Training Hubs in each target member state, an AU-EU Microbial Biobank Network, early warning systems, a risk assessment toolkit and a food safety regulatory model.

ENERGY PLANNING AND MODELLING THROUGH INTEGRATED ASSESSMENT OF CLIMATE LAND ENERGY WATER NEXUS IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA	Achieving clean energy access and food security targets in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) will require significant infrastructure expansion. Improved policy environments and governance structures are recognised as vital in scaling up funding for climate-resilient investments in renewable energy infrastructures. The efficient exploitation of land, energy and water resources and their synergised use for sustainable economic development, as well as their robustness to stressors from climate change require integrated optimisation and assessment of strategic plans in these sectors. Working with existing, widely adopted, open-source modelling tools and data, the EPIC Africa project will build on the transparent integrated assessment, and resource modelling, connecting to the already existing community of developers and users. The project will create a network of African experts to train, co-create and sustain the tools developed in the long term, which is lacking at the moment. The project will build advanced and spatially contextualised water-energy-food (WEF) models for long-term infrastructure planning. Operational WEF models with sufficient temporal and spatial resolution will be developed and used to verify cost-optimised infrastructure investment plans under different climate and socioeconomic scenarios. EPIC Africa sets out to support governance of sustainable development in SSA by forming and connecting a transition arena with stakeholders in dialogue, leading to the development of a WEF nexus digital engagement tool. Optimal use of shared resources will be exemplified for Africa using the cases of the Volta and Tana river basins. Here, we will design specific policy, investment and infrastructure plans for the coming decades in the agricultural, water and energy access sectors. The project will produce a set of institutional, regulatory and technical recommendations for sustainable management of optimised transition pathways.

ECL-based Infectious Pathogen (bio)SEnsor	"Infectious diseases are a threat to mankind since their appearance in human history. Despite the advances in science and technologies, such threats are still recurrent, as recently shown by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 – 2021, which has revealed the urgent need for novel tools for pathogen detection that would be at the same time reliable, fast, cheap, portable and simple. The goal of ECLIPSE is to address this need, with a new platform exploiting innovative ultrasensitive protocols for the detection of pathogens. ECLIPSE builds on the combination of interdisciplinary elements to facilitate the transfer to industry, i.e., (i) ElectroChemiLuminescence (ECL) as a very sensitive transduction mechanism for realizing simple, portable and cheap devices, (ii) bio-, nano-, and supramolecular-based signal amplification structures for increasing the sensitivity, and (iii) two recognition strategies to afford high affinity and selectivity, thus leading to high reliability: the Phage-Sandwich technology for the whole pathogen, and the Surface Cooperative Hybridization technology for microbial and viral nucleic acid. We will demonstrate the feasibility and adaptability of the ECLIPSE platform with three test cases: a virus (SARS-CoV-2), a bacterium (Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and a protozoan parasite (Leishmania infantum). The platform is designed to be applied to many other infectious agents, making it a ""ready for the next pandemic” technology. ECLIPSE is expected to become a game-changer in European countries, where it could be a cornerstone for fast testing and reliable tracking of infections, and in developing countries that will benefit from a cheap and simple approach to detect the many infectious diseases that affect millions of people every year. The project results will be validated and demonstrated at partners’ premisses.

Dust Study, Transport, and Electrostatic Removal for Exploration Missions	International scientific and commercial interests in exploration missions to solar system bodies such as the Moon, asteroids and comets have increased significantly. Several exploration missions are planned in the near future, in particular to the Moon. One major environmental constraint during those missions is the presence of charged dust-like particles, as they can degrade equipment by accelerating wear. Moreover, exposure to and inhalation of dust can have a range of toxic effects on human explorers. There is a recognised need for developing efficient dust mitigation systems. To develop such systems, (i) better knowledge and models of dust charging and transportation in those environments are needed, and (ii) technologies to move charged dust particles in a controlled way must be validated. The objective of the DUSTER project is to develop an instrument for in situ analysis of dust-like particles and their transport in the context of planetary and small body exploration missions. This instrument will be designed to measure for which set of parameters (electrostatic charging of particles, ambient plasma, imposed electric field) dust-like particles can be moved. The technology developed can serve as a basis to design electrostatic dust mitigation devices and dust sample-collecting equipment. The above-mentioned parameters will be determined theoretically and supported by laboratory-based measurements for particles with different properties and under different conditions. Following the requirements derived from the simulations and laboratory measurements, the individual sub-units and units of the proposed instrument will be designed. An integrated breadboard version of the instrument will be manufactured and tested with the same laboratory setup. The target is to reach TRL 4. The development, manufacturing, testing and validation of the instrument will be a joint effort between scientific, engineering and industrial teams with a strong interdisciplinary approach.

Dual circuit flow battery for hydrogen and value added chemical production	"DualFlow develops a radically new energy conversion and storage concept that combines water electrolysis, battery storage and co-production of decarbonized chemicals into one single hybrid technology using water soluble redox mediators as energy transfer vectors. 

The system can be operated for electricity storage or for energy conversion to hydrogen and value added chemicals. During energy storage operation, the system works as a conventional stationary flow battery. The energy conversion starts when the battery is full but there is abundant inexpensive green electricity available. Now the battery is chemically discharged in a mediated electrolysis to produce hydrogen and value added chemicals. The energy conversion is realized by pumping charged battery electrolytes through reactors. For hydrogen production, reactor is filled with catalytic particles to catalyze electron transfer and hydrogen evolution. For value added chemical production the reactor consists of biphasic system where charged electrolyte oxidizes chemicals in an organic phase. The reaction products are then extracted into the organic phase. The energy conversion operation requires only reactors and catalyst for hydrogen evolution, indicating that the additive costs of the dual circuit is minimal. The concept results in flexible system capable of both energy storage and energy conversion to hydrogen. We strongly believe that this concept offers possibilities to produce inexpensive hydrogen, in a flexible manner without utilizing any critical raw materials."	flow battery; mediated electrolysis; electrosynthesis	TURUN YLIOPISTO - UNIVERSITY OF TURKU	AALTO KORKEAKOULUSAATIO SR - AALTO; AARHUS UNIVERSITET - AU	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101070788/program/43108390/details	
Digital optical computing platform for neural networks	"Artificial Intelligence - humanity’s new frontier - has dramatically progressed during the past decade due to the introduction of deep learning. Deep learning applications usually require vast amounts of computing resources but microelectronics are encountering physically fundamental bottlenecks in speed, energy consumption, heating, and interconnect delay, which can no longer be resolved by scaling. The end of Moore’s law urgently calls for the introduction of new devices, new integration technologies, and new architectures to efficiently accelerate deep learning applications. Recently, optical neural networks (ONNs) based on photonic integrated circuits have shown great potential as an emerging computing architecture beyond von Neumann and Moore to overcome the bottlenecks in their microelectronics counterparts. Yet the ONN concepts and demonstrations so far are encountering severe obstacles such as limited calculation precision, repeatability, scalability, and compatibility with microelectronics. These obstacles are deeply rooted in the analogue computing architecture of the existing ONNs: insufficient signal-to-noise ratio due to accumulated noise and crosstalk in the system. 
DOLORES aims to explore and develop a radically new digital optical computing platform to create a new class of processors, namely a digital optical neural network (DONN) processor, that is fundamentally different from any ONN scheme and solves the aforementioned obstacles. Integrating the best of photonics and electronics, DOLORES is expected to revolutionize optical computing, and in the long-term vision enable new possibilities that are barely supported by today’s computing hardware. If successful, DOLORES can pave the way for a new era in AI, drastically accelerating neural networks and deep learning applications, which have the potential to transform many sectors of our society, including healthcare, finance, and transportation."	optical neural networks; optical computing; cointegration of photonics and electronics	DANMARKS TEKNISKE UNIVERSITET - TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY OF DENMARK DTU	INTERUNIVERSITAIR MICRO-ELECTRONICA CENTRUM - IMEC; KOBENHAVNS UNIVERSITET - UCPH	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101130178/program/43108390/details	
Diagnostic HER2DX-guided treatment for patients with early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer	"HER2+ breast cancer affects around 390.000 women annually worldwide (i.e. 3 patients every 4 minutes). Over the last decade, polychemotherapy and HER2-targeted therapies have improved patient´s survival; however, the reality is that most patients are cured with less intense, toxic, and costly drugs. Up to now, no diagnostic test existed to guide the optimal therapy for each patient. The 27-gene HER2DX test (TRL8) is a novel minimally invasive diagnostic tool which provides unprecedented predictive information for therapy optimization in early-stage HER2+ disease. The DEFINITIVE project will prospectively validate HER2DX`s clinical effectiveness, proving its ability to significantly i) reduce toxicities, ii) improve quality of life and ii) reduce direct and indirect costs, while maintaining efficacy endpoints and survival outcomes in patients with early HER2+ breast cancer.

DEFINITIVE will combine international experts in breast cancer from international reference hospitals, comprehensive cancer networks, regulatory, HTA and medical statistics experts, SMEs, policy makers, patient associations, living labs and medical society networks. DEFINITIVE consortium will conduct a pragmatic clinical trial across 44 centres in 7 European and associated countries to randomize 304 patients with stage II to IIIA HER2+ breast cancer, in a 1:1 manner, and to be treated with the result of the HER2DX test to guide treatment vs without the result of the test (treatment by physician´s choice according to local guidelines). The inclusion and exclusion criteria will be very broad to make sure that most patients can participate in the trial and the results could be generalized to the overall population treated in real-world settings. Beyond seeking the endorsement and implementation of HER2DX diagnostic test by clinical guidelines and healthcare systems, DEFINITIVE will boost the incorporation of affordable non-invasive diagnostic tools in the field of genomics and precision oncology.

Development of novel viral vectored vaccines against Marburgviruses inducing robust and cross-reactive protection	The frequency, magnitude, and geographical range of Marburg virus disease outbreaks are expanding, with recent cases emerging in Equatorial Guinea and Tanzania. Marburgviruses, listed among the WHO priority pathogens, have demonstrated their epidemic potential. However, no licensed vaccines are available, and outbreaks continue to impose high morbidity and mortality burdens. Vaccine candidates in the pipeline are based on the Marburg virus (MARV) glycoprotein (GP) as a single immunogen. MARVAX ambition is to improve the strength and breadth of MARV vaccines by deploying the measles virus (MV) and modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) viral vector vaccine platforms for expression of several MARV antigens: GP, viral protein 40 (VP40), which together with GP allows the formation of virus-like particles, and the nucleoprotein (NP), which contains conserved epitopes that are the main drivers of T cell responses. We will evaluate in depth the innate, adaptive and memory antigen-specific humoral and cellular cross-protective immune responses induced by MV-MARV and MVA-MARV vaccine candidates against MARV, Ravn virus and ebolaviruses, in single dose and in homologous and heterologous prime/boost immunization regimens, through an innovative preclinical testing pipeline. We will use cutting-edge and novel in vitro primary human cell co-cultures and immunocompetent mouse models to evaluate immunogenicity, chimeric and avatar mouse models to evaluate immunogenicity and efficacy and identify correlates of protection, and the highly relevant cynomolgus macaque model to evaluate safety, immunogenicity and efficacy. Furthermore, GMP batches of the best vaccine candidates will be produced by the end of the project, towards their future evaluation in a phase I clinical trial, in collaboration with the WHO-led initiative for prioritization and acceleration of clinical trials of Marburgvirus vaccines in at-risk and healthcare communities and upon outbreaks.

Development of delignified nanocellulose based gas transfer scaffold membrane for artificial lung applications.	"Lung disease is the third biggest cause of deaths globally. For the irreversible and terminal lung disease patients, lung transplantation is the only long-term therapy. Due to the unavailability the suitable donors, there is not only a minimum of 18 months of wait on the organ donation. Patients who eventually secure a lung transplant have less than 20% chance of recovery due to ‘poor organ function’. Therefore, there is not only a great need for an artificial lung as a permanent replacement organ but also as a bridge to transplantation. Existing artificial lung devices fail to mimic the flow gas exchange properties of a human lung and suffer from low biocompatibility, leading to undesired blood coagulation and hemolysis which limits their applicability to up to 30 days. The complexity and risk associated with current artificial lung technologies mean that they are not offered as long-term lung replacements or as a suitable bridge to transplantation.

Through this 36 months EIC pathfinder project, the consortium led by Smart Reactors Ireland, aims to develop the world’s first biobased nanomaterial ‘nanocellulose’ to manufacture an artificial lung device used as a bridge to lung transplantation. The consortium will develop an initial proof of concept nanocellulose device to demonstrate gas transfer and initial hemocompatibility in blood. The proposed approach is expected to have two benefits, the first is that blood flow can occur in laminar flow conditions reducing haemolysis and damage to the blood. Secondly, nanocellulose, has the potential to be endothelialized which would allow for long term gas exchange without the need for

Development of a novel highly efficient energy supply system for energy autonomous multi-family buildings based on biomass gasification coupled with an SOFC and a PV system	"The project aims at the development of an innovative RES-based system for heat and electricity supply in order to achieve an almost energy autonomous multi-family building with regard to heating and electricity consumption as well as electro-mobility. This shall be achieved by integrating a novel highly efficient biomass micro-CHP technology based on an updraft gasifier, a new gas cleaning system and a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC), a state-of-the-art PV system and appropriate innovative energy storage solutions. This system shall be economically highly attractive for future users and it shall also distinguish itself by virtually zero emissions of CO, OGC and dust as well as 55% to 65% reduced NOx emissions compared to other biomass CHP technologies. Consequently, it shall increase the penetration of RES on the multi-family house level and has the potential to significantly contribute to reaching the EU climate and clean air goals.
The key innovations of the project are related to the novel micro-scale biomass CHP system. They comprise a flexible partitioning of product gas supplied to the SOFC and to a gas burner in order to cover the overall heat demand and to maximise SOFC operation at the same time, a novel combined thermal and catalytic tar reformer, new highly efficient and durable stack units and a novel compact SOFC system with integrated HCl and H2S removal reactor. Based on a 2.5 kWel SOFC with an electric efficiency of 44%, which is flexibly coupled with a 14 kW gasifier, overall efficiencies of more than 90% shall be gained. A TRL of 5 shall be achieved at the end of the project.
The methodology applied to reach these goals relies on technology development tasks (based on process simulations, CFD aided design of the single units, test plant construction, performance and evaluation of test runs), a technology assessment part covering risk, techno-economic, environmental and overall impact assessments as well as targeted dissemination activities.

Development and characterization of a pan-flavivirus vaccine candidate	Dengue, yellow fever, Zika, and West Nile viruses are mosquito-borne flaviviruses and global public health burdens that infect half a billion people annually, causing 250,000 deaths, and threaten nearly the entire human population. In a context of human-driven global changes, these threats will intensify with larger and more frequent epidemics, potentially leading to pandemics, will expand with geographic spreading of the mosquito vectors, and will multiply with the likely emergence of yet-unknown flaviviruses. Improving pandemic preparedness and response to these emerging and re-emerging diseases is a top priority both for the EU and WHO. However, there are no effective interventions against all flaviviruses and current vaccines targeting flaviviral proteins have severe safety issues. FLAVIVACCINE’s high-impact/low-risk/disruptive ambition is to develop a novel, broad-spectrum, mosquito saliva-targeted vaccine candidate that protects against multiple different flaviviruses and is ready for clinical evaluation by building upon an experimentally-validated proof-of-concept. FLAVIVACCINE will define the immunogenicity of the pan-flavivirus target, develop and characterize a vaccine candidate against multiple flaviviruses, and prepare it for clinical evaluation. To reach these goals, FLAVIVACCINE creates a unique interdisciplinary environment of ten public and private institutions, including Universities, Research Institutions and a Vaccine Developer, from seven countries to cover all the required scientific expertise and knowledge in cell biology, virology, immunology and vaccinology. The pan-flavivirus vaccine candidate that will be validated against dengue, yellow fever, Zika and West Nile diseases in several preclinical models, together with the knowledge and networks resulting from FLAVIVACCINE, will have short- and long-term impact on the EU ability to combat epidemic and pandemic viral threats, and protect communities and citizens in the EU and around the world.	flavivirus; mosquito saliva; vaccine development; extracellular vesicles; animal models; pandemic preparedness; broad-spectrum vaccine	INSTITUT DE RECHERCHE POUR LE DEVELOPPEMENT - IRD	AGENCIA ESTATAL CONSEJO SUPERIOR DE INVESTIGACIONES CIENTIFICAS - CSIC; COMMISSARIAT A L ENERGIE ATOMIQUE ET AUX ENERGIES ALTERNATIVES - CEA	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101137006/program/43108390/details	
Deconstructing the protective immunity of yellow fever virus 17D to inform flavivirus vaccine design	While endemic to the tropics, flaviviruses like Zika, dengue, West Nile or yellow fever virus are re-emerging pathogens of global health concern. Climate change and urbanization have largely contributed to the dissemination of their mosquito vector and Europe has in recent years been regularly confronted with autochthonous cases. Few vaccines are licensed to prevent flavivirus disease, but the yellow fever 17D (YF17D) vaccine has a unique track record of efficiency and safety. Intriguingly, despite its success, how YF17D induces immunity remains poorly understood. The YELLOW4FLAVI consortium aims to fill the gaps in our understanding of the mechanism of action of this vaccine by linking the structure of the viral particle to the resulting host immune response, in order to learn about optimal vaccine design for flaviviruses in general. Since social acceptance of vaccines is critical for their success, we will also develop optimal communication methods. This will provide us with the tools to tailor vaccine design not only to achieve optimal immune protection, but also to facilitate actual implementation.We are molecular and structural virologists, cell biologists, immunologists, computational scientists, clinicians, and social scientists assembled in a tight collaborative network. To pursue our goal of obtaining a blueprint for determinants of long-lasting immunity for flavivirus vaccine candidates, we will use cutting-edge technologies like cryo-EM, super resolution microscopy, spatial transcriptomics, high-dimensional spectral flow cytometry, single-cell RNA sequencing, advanced cell engineering, small animal models, and clinical studies. In a unique manner, the consortium thereby follows a thread of events from the early response at the site of vaccine injection to the population perception of vaccination, harnessing an enhanced understanding of one of the most successful vaccines of mankind for the development of novel lines of defense against new and old threats.

Decipher cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs) by digital tools to produce flavonoids and terpenoids	"Microbial production of plant metabolites has economic & environmental benefits over traditional extraction and chemical methods. Despite initial progress & the successful market introduction of some molecules, the microbial production of oxygenated plant metabolites (OPMs) mediated by cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs) is still lagging, making them almost inaccessible to society. In contrast, artificial intelligence (AI) & machine learning (ML) tools are evolving rapidly, but their use for engineering biology is still underexplored. deCYPher applies these groundbreaking AI/ML techniques to unlock the OPM molecules to society.

deCYPher develops a standardised AI/ML pipeline to implement AI/ML in each step of the Design-Build-Test-Learn cycle, and across all steps in the biotech value chain. Combined with smart databases & synthetic biology (SynBio) tools, this AI/ML pipeline will generate opportunities for the whole biotech sector. Specifically, applied to OPMs, we (1) bioprospect & select specific CYPs, (2) correctly localise & express CYPs and (3) optimise the microbial cells & bioprocess. deCYPher involves stakeholders (industry, regulators, NGOs) and engages European citizens across several countries. This allows to reflect on the societal ramifications of the convergence of AI & SynBio. 

The consortium brings together complementary expertise from 5 top RTOs, 3 SMEs, 1 LE & 1 bio-art association from 6 EU countries to unlock the full potential of OPMs. In parallel, deCYPher will enable the AI/ML sector to apply their tools in the biotech sector, by creating new production tools for industrial biotech and specifically impact industry (flavours & fragrances, phytonutrient) and society with novel products. deCYPher contributes to the EU green deal, supports the transition to a circular bioeconomy, increases resource efficiency, strengthens European competitiveness, innovates in a responsible and reflective manner & boosts sustainability of biobased value chains."	learning techniques; synthetic biology; functionalisation; oxygenated plant metabolites	UNIVERSITEIT GENT - UGent	AGENCIA ESTATAL CONSEJO SUPERIOR DE INVESTIGACIONES CIENTIFICAS - CSIC; BARCELONA SUPERCOMPUTING CENTER CENTRO NACIONAL DE SUPERCOMPUTACION - BSC CNS	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101081782/program/43108390/details	
DURABILITY MODELLING OF COMPOSITE STRUCTURES WITH ARBITRARY LAY-UP USING STANDARDIZED TESTING AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE	"Advanced composite manufacturing is becoming crucial in the global sustainable drive for a climate-neutral future as enabler of light-weight structures in, for example, the aerospace and wind energy sector. Their increased relevance has raised the importance of damage tolerance and durability of composite structures, currently dealt with time-consuming and inaccurate techniques. Hence the objective of D-STANDART is to develop fast and efficient methods to model the durability of large-scale composite structures with arbitrary lay-ups under realistic conditions (loads, environment). 
New test methodologies will be developed using generic specimens to correctly quantify material parameters that determine the durability of composites under cyclical loading. Material characterisation will be used in high-fidelity models to simulate defect growth in various lay-ups and at various scales as a function of cyclical loading and rate. To apply these models in an industrial design environment, D-STANDART will make use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) surrogate models, trained using test data from the project and historical test data to easily adapt to different design parameters and complex lay-ups, thereby accelerating the development, uptake, and commercialisation of advanced components. Two use cases have been selected to validate the modelled durability performance both in the aerospace and renewable energy sectors. Furthermore, circularity and sustainability will be assessed via dedicated life-cycle assessment, life cycle costing and cost-benefit analysis. 
This 36-month €5.6M valued action involves, 9 partners (3 universities, 2 RTOs, 2 industry, and 2 SMEs) from four countries (United Kingdom, The Netherlands, Germany, and France). The consortium will be supported by an Advisory Board formed of 6 End users embracing the value chain to validate requirements, guide on relevant approach to certification, and finally support results uptake, in tight alignment with EMCC."	fatigue; composites; durability; modelling; standardization; manufacturing; artificial intelligence; life cycle assessment	STICHTING KONINKLIJK NEDERLANDS LUCHT - EN RUIMTEVAARTCENTRUM - Royal Netherlands Aerospace Centre Amsterdam	L - UP SAS -; MSC SOFTWARE GMBH - MSC	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101091409/program/43108390/details	
DNA-based Infrastructure for Storage and Computation	"Throughout evolution, Biology has found an almost-perfect molecule to pass information down through the millennia.  Whether for a simple bacterium or the largest whale, DNA achieves high information density while permitting cellular machinery rapid random-access retrieval to decode everything from a single protein to the development of an entire human brain.  Humanity's rapidly-growing data storage and computing needs make it is tempting to exploit optimised biological molecules and processes, but biology is messy, poorly-understood and much more specialised for life than it is for our needs -- we propose to use DNA for storage together with a rationally designed, well-characterised and robust molecular computing architecture.

The DISCO project will address the challenge of engineering a programmable and robust DNA storage and computing platform.  DISCO combines powerful molecular-algorithmic ideas from DNA computing with notions of thermodynamic stability from DNA nanostructures, to provide an expressive and robust system design.  The project proposes the use of long DNA scaffold strands, upon which hundreds of smaller strands bind to store data, which can be later read, erased, rewritten and computed upon.  DISCO begins with the aim of trialing a small, but thoroughly characterised and modelled prototype, that facilitates storage and computation on 10 bits.  Then, DISCO will scale-up the system to hundreds of  bits by leveraging recent technological advances to enable high-throughput techniques at both the experimental and data-readout stages.  Finally, DISCO will be extended to two-dimensional DNA origami structures, each carrying about a hundred bits, but with millions of structures in the same test tube, exhibiting DNA storage and computation in a distributed system at a massively parallel scale."

DIGITAL SOLUTIONS FOR ACCELERATED BATTERY TESTING	The current paradigm for battery testing is fragmented, time-consuming, and expensive. To fully characterize the performance of a battery cell requires a wide variety of both destructive and non-destructive tests, some of which can last for months or years. A new paradigm for battery testing is needed that takes full advantage of the latest advances in automation, data science, and modelling to bring battery development firmly into the digital era. DigiBatt will slingshot the European battery industry forward by developing novel digital approaches to extract more value from fewer tests. This will save valuable time and resources in a highly competitive industry. DigiBatt has assembled a consortium representing some of the world's leading battery research institutions, Gigafactories, and integrators, and will apply recent advances in autonomous battery testing, model-based simulation, and data-driven semantics to promote digital battery testing from TRL 4 to TRL 6.

DE-centralised Cloud labs fOr inDustrialisation of Energy materials	DECODE aims at creating and demonstrating a decentralised and adaptable future lab concept that connects multiple labs on a single platform in order to boost the effectiveness and speed-up the development and innovation path for clean energy materials and technologies. Initially demonstrated for selected hydrogen technologies, the DECODE platform is expected to find wide adoption in the clean technology field in the longer run, including energy harvesting, conversion and storage; clean water technologies; and the synthesis of value-added chemicals and fuels. The core of the platform comprises three elements: the DECODE FABRIC that connects adaptative multi-scale modelling and characterisation suites in a matrix-like structure; a scoring concept to assess modelling and characterisation suites in terms of their integration readiness level (IRL); and an AI-enabled central unit (CPU) that processes the IRL scores, performs the technology mapping to the FABRIC and orchestrates contributions in modelling and characterisation from partner labs. For the platform as a whole, DECODE strives to achieve a high level of flexibility, adaptability, and interoperability, in terms of materials modification strategies, technologies and operating regimes that it will be able to handle. Water electrolysis and hydrogen fuel cell technologies are selected for the demonstration of DECODE’s decentralised labs platform. The project will join leading expertise and capabilities in physical theory and modelling, design, fabrication, operando characterisation and testing of functional materials and components, materials digitalisation and cloud-connected lab operations, and industrial-grade component integration and in-line/end-of-line testing and validation by industrial partners in the consortium.

Cryogenic storage and refuelling in space	"To move away from the dependence on hydrazine for space propulsion, greener alternatives must be sought. Cryogenic propellant combinations such as oxygen / methane offer higher specific impulses than storable combinations, but their low saturation temperatures raise additional challenges with respect to preventing their evaporation during long-term storage. While the ability to refuel craft with cryogenic propellants would allow for longer-term manned missions to Mars and the Moon, as well as aid in the improvement of in-space sustainability, preventing the evaporation of the propellants during the transfer process also poses challenges. As of today, neither long-term storage nor refuelling with cryogenic propellants has been demonstrated in-orbit. 

CRYSALIS will develop and mature the technologies needed for the management of cryogenic propellant for future space transportation and in-orbit servicing activities. This maturation will include performing a small-scale in-orbit demonstration to mature those whose performance can only be characterised in a microgravity environment. This will be a closed-system demonstrator flown on-board the Nyx capsule, which will aim to not only demonstrate the feasibility of such processes but will aim to improve the understanding of the behaviour of such propellants under microgravity, allowing for development of future systems. 

These technologies will aid in ensuring the independent access of the EU to space, in particular to manned and heavy missions beyond GEO and LEO, by supporting the development of a logistical network of craft, depots, and hubs, required for cis-lunar and future Martian missions.

Creating leverage to enhance biodiversity outcomes of global biomass trade	CLEVER identifies new leverage points for sustainable transformation informed by a novel holistic approach to quantify biodiversity and other impacts of trade in major raw and processed non-food biomass value chains. In line with Pillars 3 & 4 of the EU Biodiversity Strategy 2030, we address all outcomes of this topic by adopting perspectives at the system and value chain levels. At the system level, we improve our understanding of leakage effects in the non-food biomass trade system informed by quasi-experimental evaluation techniques, quantitative scenario modelling, and policy case studies. At the value chain level, CLEVER engages with key stakeholders (i.e., producers, traders, retailers, civil society, and policy makers) in R&I co-design to identify leverage points for transformative change at corporate and institutional levels. Value chain analyses will produce ‘ecological footprints’ from advanced life cycle analyses and enhance our understanding of actor-specific behavior focusing on trade in soy, timber, wood pulp, and fishmeal/oil between Europe, South America, and Central Africa. Further CLEVER products and tools to influence decision-making at the right level include (1) improved indicators of biodiversity loss to inform business and policy, (2) enhanced features for the global modelling platform GLOBIOM to quantify trade-mediated leakage and SDG interdependencies in biomass value chains, and (3) an innovation action pool to support public and private decision-makers in choosing governance instruments that effectively enhance biodiversity and promote climate change mitigation and adaptation. Building on prior and ongoing engagement of its members at the science-policy interface and through partnerships with other projects under the destination on biodiversity and ecosystem services, the consortium will leverage CLEVER knowledge and tools to strengthen IPBES and IPCC and enhance science-industry cooperation for sustainable bioeconomic transformation.

CorrelAtes of Protective immuniTy-driven Investigation of malaria VAccine combinaTion stratEgies	Malaria remains a serious health concern worldwide, with P. falciparum considered one of the deadliest human parasites. Yet, the currently approved vaccine against malaria (RTS,S/AS01) offers limited protection due to challenges in vaccine development. Using current advances made in understanding immunity to address some of the existing challenges, this proposal aims to develop a more efficacious vaccine against P. falciparum by targeting multiple developmental stages (sporozoite, liver and blood-stage). In this project, combinations of 1) highly promising whole parasite vaccination approach targeting the liver (late-arresting GAP), 2) RTS,S (provided by GSK) and 3) mRNA versions of clinically evaluated and partially protective blood stage vaccine candidates (Rh5, AMA1-DiCo [sporozoite and blood stage]) will be evaluated in preclinical and small-scale human trials to discern the optimal combination for further clinical investigations. To inform a rational design of future vaccine candidates, CAPTIVATE will analyse the vaccine-induced immune response to acquire a full understanding of malaria protective immunity and develop an advanced immunology in-silico platform. While immunity to blood stage malaria is relatively well understood, the mechanisms of adaptive protective immunity for pre-erythrocytic malaria vaccine candidates are less well-established. CAPTIVATE addresses this critical knowledge gap by combining state-of-the-art preclinical and clinical (CHMI) in vivo malaria vaccine efficacy models with an innovative in-silico platform comprising TCR/VDJ sequencing and artificial intelligence predictions, to identify such mechanisms. CAPTIVATE assembles a unique combination of European experts in their respective fields (malaria modelling in primates, clinical vaccine testing, in-silico modelling of immune responses, innovative omics approaches) in an integrated interdisciplinary approach aimed at bringing the next generation malaria vaccines to the clinic.	malaria; vaccines; mRNA; platform development; mathematical modelling; In-silico	EUROPEAN VACCINE INITIATIVE E.V - EUROPEAN VACCINE INITIATIVE e.V	ACADEMISCH ZIEKENHUIS LEIDEN - Leiden University Medical Center; DEUTSCHES KREBSFORSCHUNGSZENTRUM HEIDELBERG - GERMAN CANCER RESEARCH CENTER	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101081028/program/43108390/details	
Computational, Chemical and Biotechnology Solutions to Improved DNA Data Storage: from In-Product Information and Cryptography to Long-Term Archiving	Modern information-based society largely relies on trusted information storage in a large variety of setups, ranging from long-term digital archiving to embedding information into products. DNA is a promising future storage medium for such diverse applications as it offers sustainable and robust long-term information storage at extraordinary information density. DNA will also never become obsolete. However, long-term DNA archival storage is still very expensive. In DiDAX, we will develop new approaches to DNA storage based on novel encoding and decoding algorithms, new reduced cost synthesis approaches and new embedding technologies. Specifically, we will provide (i) synthesis, encoding and decoding methods for efficient reduced cost archiving using standard and composite DNA, (ii) in-product information storage technologies, including encapsulation and embedding, as well as tailored coding and reconstruction approaches, (iii)  methods for efficient labeling and cryptographic authentication, and (iv) efficient and new approaches to photolithography-based synthesis and composite synthesis of DNA, to enable reduced-cost DNA storage. We will demonstrate end-to-end PoC systems for reduced-cost archival storage, in-product information storage as well as DNA-based authentication protocols. The DiDAX project will expand the long-term applicability of archival DNA-based data storage through significant improvements in cost. Furthermore, DiDAX will broaden the range of DNA-based information technologies and lead to applications realizable in the short term by developing in-product information storage solutions and DNA-based authentication protocols. DiDAX methodology is highly interdisciplinary building on expertise in computer science, engineering, chemistry, material science, and in building complete DNA based storage systems. DiDAX impact spans applications and technology domains and will be disseminated and exploited to benefit European society and industry.

Computation driven development of novel vivo-like-DNA-nanotransducers for biomolecules structure identification	The link between the structural change of a molecule and its function is of fundamental importance since it provides direct insight on mechanism of complex biological processes. Recent years have witnessed noticeable advances of analysis of complex molecular conformations, however the understanding of their conformational dynamics remain a formidable challenge and revolutionary advances are still demanded the analysis of chemical composition and structure of biomolecules, however the understanding of their conformational dynamics remains a formidable challenge, and revolutionary advances are still demanded. Molecular machines, such as the DNA itself, which work at the core of many cellular activities, is able to DNA modify its conformation and to transduce the signal upon binding to specific proteins.  In this project, we will develop a DNA-nanotrasducer for real-time detection of conformational changes and the analysis of molecular dynamics as it occurs in-vivo biological processes. The project aims to provide: (i) the development of DNA-nanotransducers that can perform both detection and conformational analysis of molecular dynamics in one functional unit (ii), Use bioinformatics approaches to predict 3D structure of conformational states modelling real time evolution of interacting DNA-NT and proteins, and machine learning (ML) models to directly link the atomistic structure, conformational state, and dynamics (iii) Assess protein-DNA-NT binding by experimental approaches using linear and “on-chip” non-linear spectroscopies for the detection of vibrational signatures of organic molecular systems, to recognize consequent structural changes in the optical signal in real-time, (iv) Describe DNA-NT/protein interactions at the cellular level and 3D analysis of DNA-NT and model proteins, towards drug discovery. These research efforts will provide a foundation for a next generation of DNA-nanotransducers to be used for high-throughput functional molecular structure.

Comprehensive Analysis of RBM20-induced Dilated Cardiomyopathies using Omics Approaches and Repair Interventions	In CARDIOREPAIR, we aim to identify and repair disease-causing variants in dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), the major contributor to heart failure. We focus on the gene RBM20 mutated in patients with a highly penetrant and aggressive form of familial DCM. We will create a comprehensive map of all possible RBM20 variants that can cause DCM and develop a therapeutic approach for mutations with the strongest effect size. Enabled by a multitude of new technologies developed in our groups, the primary goal is to characterize the complete spectrum of amino acid mutations in RBM20 by high-throughput saturation mutagenesis screens. Combined with functional readouts and multi-omics analysis of downstream processes, we will classify and score the pathogenicity of each individual mutant (objective 1). To this end, we will cover both the known DCM-causing RBM20 variants, as well as those that have not been identified in patients yet. Each mutant, represented by a typical transcriptomic, proteomic, phosphoproteomic, and microscopic fingerprint, will guide us in finding novel class-specific therapeutic strategies to revert the deviant phenotype back to the healthy state. For a subset of mutants representing each identified mutation class, we will generate mouse models and investigate changes in heart physiology and ultrastructure linked to the altered ‘ome’ profile. Our second goal is to establish a class-specific therapeutic approach for the treatment of patients harboring RBM20 mutations (objective 2). We will implement our advances in muscle-specific gene editing, focusing on prime editing and nanobody-guided approaches to specifically tackle the mutations leading to RBM20 translocation. This proposal serves as a blueprint for going from variant identification to therapy in an accelerated fashion by harnessing and combining the power of high-throughput functional genomics and bioengineering and therefore is widely applicable to other cardiovascular diseases (CVD).	dilated cardiomyopathy; RBM20; saturation mutagenesis screen; prime editing; multi-omics profiling	EUROPEAN MOLECULAR BIOLOGY LABORATORY - EMBL	HELMHOLTZ ZENTRUM MUENCHEN DEUTSCHES FORSCHUNGSZENTRUM FUER GESUNDHEIT UND UMWELT GMBH - HMGU	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101115574/program/43108390/details	
Complex chemical reaction networks for breakthrough scalable reservoir computing	"The brain is the world’s most amazing computer and it runs entirely on chemical reactions. The vision of CORENET is to construct brain-mimicking computing devices that utilise networks of chemical reactions as molecular information processing systems. To achieve this vision, we will implement reservoir computing (RC) on microfluidic chips using chemical reaction networks (CRNs) that convert input feedstock molecules and environmental conditions into a pattern of product molecules. This pattern can be monitored on a chip using a combination of high-throughput mass spectrometry analysis, algorithmic cheminformatics and AI tools.  
CORENET will generate a breakthrough in highly scalable and functional chemical RC by integrating our partners’ new knowledge and state-of-the-art methodologies in systems and analytical chemistry, microfluidics, cheminformatics and machine learning. CORENET will produce microfluidic chip devices that perform high-level computing with molecules, synthesising and analysing a pattern of output molecules in situ. This molecule-based computing power enables truly sustainable AI and speaks the language of living systems, which constantly process information about their molecular environment. Future applications of our chemical RC system lie in implantable devices, brain-machine interfaces and personalised medicine. 
CORENET brings together 4 leading scientists with complimentary expertise that covers all fundamental aspects of this project. Their expertise is combined with the world-class knowledge in AI/ML modelling of a high-tech global industry partner with unique research and computing infrastructure, while an SME specialised in the communication and dissemination of results will ensure maximised impact.

Community-based engagement and intervenTions to stem the spread of antimicrobial resistance in the aqUatic environments catalysed by cLImate change and Plastic pollution interactions	Interconnections between ecological and societal systems facilitate compounding impacts of climate change, environmental plastic pollution and proliferation of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) on the health of people, animals and ecosystems on a planetary scale. Current knowledge on interactions between these three crises in the Earth’s natural systems and their impact on health is highly restricted. TULIP will apply a transdisciplinary socio-ecological systems thinking approach, robust environmental science methods, epidemiology, modelling, sampling design and state-of-the-art molecular tools to generate scientific evidence on plastic-AMR interactions. It will describe spatio-temporal dynamics and patterns of plastic-associated AMR under a changing climate and the compounding health and ecological impacts. It will employ the methodology of intervention and social sciences to explore social driving factors and current policies and design and evaluate community-based interventions and nature-based solutions. TULIP will convert created evidence to modelling-based decision-supporting tools that approximate co-benefits to human and ecosystem health, indicators and environmental policy recommendations highlighting triple-win solutions and foster the science-policy translation using an integrated knowledge translation framework. Aiming to ignite a lasting societal change toward health-promoting environments, TULIP will engage communities, citizen scientists, policymakers and experts from multiple sectors in research, co-design, co-implementation, communication and dissemination processes. TULIP will focus on aquatic environments as they create a milieu for interactions, transport pathways and exposure interface and showcase its approach in the Philippines and Italy and translate to a pan-European scale.

Combining Artificial Intelligence and smart sensing TOward better management and improved quality of LIFE in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease	"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a highly prevalent chronic condition. While COPD is a lung disease, it is mainly the exacerbations and extrapulmonary comorbidities which affect the quality of life, health care costs, and prognosis. The optimal COPD treatment needs to focus on both the characteristics and consequences of the lung disease itself and the diagnosis and treatment of comorbidities. While the severity of lung function impairment is routinely assessed, the exacerbations, the associated comorbidities and limitations in daily life are still significantly underestimated. A personalized approach to COPD management is needed to specifically address the disease, prevent exacerbations, and mitigate its comorbidities to obtain a positive impact on patient health and quality of life. 
TOLIFE will clinically validate an artificial intelligence (AI) solution to process daily life patient data captured by unobtrusive sensors to enable optimised personalised treatment, assessment of health outcomes and improved quality of life in COPD patients. The TOLIFE approach to COPD management, targeted to predict and mitigate exacerbations and continuously assess the health outcomes, has the potential to reduce mortality, improve health related quality of life and reduce the healthcare costs.
TOLIFE will develop and clinically validate an AI-based platform for the early prediction of exacerbations and assessment of the health outcomes. Prediction of exacerbations and assessment of health outcomes will be exploited by clinicians through a patient management tool to perform early and personalized treatment. TOLIFE platform will inform through a disease information tool the patient and caregivers about the patient's health status, the specific treatment plan and lifestyle indications. Two clinical studies will be implemented, one to collect data for AI-tools development and the other to validate the effectiveness of TOLIFE to reduce the risk of exacerbations."

Collaborative Radio - Light Detection And Ranging	"This proposal aims at developing an advanced detection and ranging sensor system based on a collaborative scheme, integrating on the same module both radio and light-based sensing. The module will consist of: a silicon photonics solid-state light detection and ranging (LiDAR) chip, with integrated laser source and driver electronics; a CMOS radio detection and ranging (RADAR) chip connected to a single transmitting (Tx) and receiving (Rx) set of antennas; a processing unit (PU) to actively control the two sensors and process the generated data. The LiDAR and RADAR chip will be integrated on the same printed circuit board (PCB) avoiding any use of free space optics. The proposed architecture will allow an active cooperation of the two sensors through an advanced algorithm installed on the PU. 
CoRaLi-DAR advanced sensor system will exploit LiDAR’s high-resolution capabilities, and RADAR’s strong reliability in adverse weather conditions, to deliver an automotive compatible detection and ranging system. The use of fully integrated photonics and electronics will reduce packaging size, manufacturing cost and ultimately operational power. With CoRaLi-DAR we plan to create a low-cost, low power and reliable sensor system that can be used as a platform for the automotive market and beyond.

Coherent, Acceptable, Low Emission Cultural Heritage Efficient Renovation	"Historic buildings represents a considerable share of the European building stock (around 25%). They contribute to the identity and uniqueness of many cities and will only survive if they are maintained as a living space. To preserve a living built heritage, it is necessary to find energy renovation approaches and solutions compatible with conservation rules. This means that the historical and aesthetic value of these properties must be preserved while increasing the comfort of these living spaces, and minimizing their energy consumption and their environmental impact.
The project aims to establish new knowledge for the development of sustainable and efficient solutions for historic buildings in order to bring cultural heritage to life and make it open, accessible, inclusive, resilient and low-emission. It is part of the pursuit of various projects involving members of the CALECHE network concerning, for example, bio-sourced renovation or ""custom"" PV integration.

Coherent and cross-compliant ocean governance for delivering the EU Green Deal for European Seas	The three-year CrossGov project aims to enhance knowledge on how coherence and cross-compliance of marine related policies and legislation affect the ability to realise the goals of the EU Green Deal for the protection of marine ecosystems and biodiversity, and to co-create proposals and roadmaps towards this end. A core strength of CrossGov is the close collaboration with the policymaking community that will be engaged in co-creation of knowledge and recommendations for solutions. The background for the project is the complex multi-level and multi-sector governance system created by global and regional international frameworks, the EU and the European coastal states. This policy landscape has not managed to halt the degradation of European seas and will be challenged further by the EU Green Deal’s call for transformative changes. Based on scenarios and methodological guidance for studies of coherence, cross-compliance and scientific advice, the project will analyse how policies and legislation at various levels support or impede progress towards the Green Deal in the marine domain. The practical results of attempts to implement the various requirements will be studied in three regional cases (the North Sea, the Baltic and the Mediterranean), and in five national cases (Finland, Norway, Netherlands, France, Italy). The insights gained will be discussed with CrossGov’s Stakeholder Forum to co-create recommendations for better integrated policies towards implementing the Green Deal in the marine context.  The  innovative, web-based and fit-for purpose roadmaps and methodological guidelines will enable policymakers to effectively foster environmentally sustainable law and governance that is fit-for-purpose for delivering the societal transformation called for.

Cognitive robotic tools for human-centered small-scale multi-robot operations	Robots are still often regarded as large machines with links, gears, and electric motors, autonomously interacting with the surrounding environment. Despite the great research efforts in robotics and human-robot interaction (HRI), the way we design, use, and control robots has not fundamentally changed in the past 20 years. We see in small-scale wireless multi-robot systems and cognitive HRI a revolutionary answer to nowadays robots limitations. Instead of large, tethered machines, that are difficult for the human user to control, REGO proposes an innovative set of AI-powered, modular, microsized swarms of robots. They are wirelessly steered by electromagnetic fields as well as able to react to other external stimuli, and then naturally controlled by humans through intuitive dexterous interfaces and interaction techniques. Taking advantage of AI multi-robot control strategies, these robots can team up and collaborate to fulfill complex tasks in a robust and unprecedented flexible way. By exploiting multisensory interaction techniques and cognitive shared control, the operator will achieve an unparalleled level of seamless interaction and continuous collaboration with the robotic team. According to the application at hand, the robotic team will feature different task-specific characteristics (e.g., biocompatibility for medical procedures, biodenitrification for cleaning water, ability to carry drugs to fight infections) and be dispatched through various delivery systems, including a stimuli-responsive milli-scale wireless robotic carrier developed within the project. To achieve this revolution, REGO will develop magnetic multi-robot motion control systems, autonomous swarm control techniques for micro-sized robots, human-robot haptic-centered interfaces, and cognitive shared-control techniques. REGO enables the next generation of AI-powered interactive small-size multi-robots systems, with increased capabilities to work with each other and their human operators.	human-robot interaction; multi-robot systems; microrobotics; haptics	CENTRE NATIONAL DE LA RECHERCHE SCIENTIFIQUE CNRS - CNRS	CENTRE HOSPITALIER UNIVERSITAIRE DE RENNES - CHU RENNES; FONDAZIONE ISTITUTO ITALIANO DI TECNOLOGIA - IIT	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101070066/program/43108390/details	
Climate Tipping Points: Uncertainty-aware quantification of Earth system tipping potential from observations and models and assessment of associated climatic, ecological, and socioeconomic impacts	The likelihood of large-scale Earth system tipping events under ongoing anthropogenic forcing remains uncertain. In view of the possible irreversibility associated with such events and the potentially catastrophic global consequences on climate, ecosystems, and society, the precautionary principle demands thorough investigation of the underlying mechanisms, compound or cascading impacts, and associated risks. ClimTip will substantially advance the process understanding of possible Earth system Tipping Elements (TEs). It will provide the methodological framework for characterising and constraining potential TEs from paleoclimate, observational and model data, for identifying unknown tipping potential from observations and models, and for quantifying resilience and changes thereof in climate and ecosystems, including early-warning of forthcoming transitions. Earth system models (ESMs) are the primary tool for projecting the risk of large-scale tipping events and ClimTip will substantially improve their representation of suggested TEs. This will enable the identification of safe operating spaces for a stable Earth system by characterising key Earth system TEs in terms of their critical thresholds and rates, hysteresis and overshoot potential via empirical data and ESMs, taking into account the associated uncertainties. As a unique climate service, ClimTip will provide global high-resolution bias-corrected climate fields for large-scale tipping events based on storylines of tipping in comprehensive ESMs. The associated impacts on climate, ecosystems, biodiversity, agriculture, society and economy will be assessed globally and put in relation with the Paris Agreement and the EU Biodiversity Strategy 2030. ClimTip will deliver a comprehensive and precise knowledge basis for tipping-aware risk assessment and adaptation and mitigation strategies. Results will be disseminated to the scientific community, general public, and targeted audiences including IPBES and IPCC.

Climate Neutral and Digitalized Laser Based Surface Functionalization of Parts with Complex Geometry	"In the coming years, the European industry must assume the challenge of adopting clean and climate-neutral industrial value chains, producing sustainable products. Adopting digital systems will radically change the industry with products and services through innovative production processes. In particular, fully digitalised laser-based additive manufacturing methods are very versatile and thus can be implemented in different industries. Furthermore, energy saves against conventional manufacturing and material waste but also by design optimization can be achieved. However, these parts also required of additional surface treatments, which are nowadays energy and material-consuming, increasing costs and harming the environment. In addition, new concepts for increasing the added value of AM parts must be developed, for instance, by producing advanced surface functionalities in critical applications. The main objective of the CLASCO project is to develop a universal and digitalised laser-based post-process route for creating functionalised AM parts with complex shapes.
While the complex parts will be produced by Laser Powder Bed Fusion, Laser polishing and laser surface micro-structuring using Direct Laser Interference Patterning will be combined in a unique manufacturing system. This route will substitute several resource-consuming processes, reducing the environment's negative impact. The implementation will allow substituting standard environmental non-friendly methods and even obtaining a better performance. In addition, different in-line monitoring methods, specifically plasma sensors and infrared cameras will be implemented. In this way, a virtual representation of the process for each part will be possible (digital twin), creating an entirely digitised product. The project's impacts will be analysed to optimise the sustainability of processes and products across the entire life cycle."

Clean bioenergy for industry - Novel fuel flexible highly efficient and close-to-zero emission combined biomass gasification and combustion technology for industrial applications	"CBE4I aims at the development of a novel, fuel-flexible biomass updraft gasification based technology for a highly energy efficient, almost zero emission and zero waste process heat supply for flexible implementation at industrial settings satisfying the specific demands of industry. Low-value biomass residues which are available in large quantities shall be applied.
CBE4I shall provide either (i) heat at different temperature levels which can be applied for indirectly heated processes via product gas combustion in an almost zero-emission gas burner with integrated three-way catalyst flexibly coupled with different boiler types (hot water, thermal oil, steam) or (ii) process heat and a clean product gas via product gas extraction with integrated thermal and catalytic tar reforming for utilisation in gas burners for direct heating. A novel flue gas condensation concept with directly coupled heat pump shall boost efficiency up to 120% (related to the NCV of the fuel). A newly developed condensate treatment shall allow for a direct discharge into sewers and regarding ash utilisation a new concept for application of biomass ashes in fertilizer production shall be developed. Moreover, CBE4I shall include the necessary fuel pre-treatment technologies and fuel logistics suitable for industrial sites. The latter comprise space saving on-site fuel logistics and on-line fuel quality assessment based on a new intelligent crane system. 
The methodology applied to reach these goals relies on technology development tasks (based on process simulations, CFD aided design of the single units, test plant construction, performance and evaluation of test runs), a technology assessment part covering risk assessments, LCAs, techno-economic, environmental and overall impact assessments as well as targeted dissemination activities.

Clean and efficient microCHCP by micro turbine based hybrid systems	"Fit4Micro aims to develop a hybrid microCHP unit running on sustainable liquid biofuels. Application is foreseen at multi-family houses, and more specifically at remote and/or off-grid locations. The innovative system is based on a double shaft micro gas turbine (mGT) combined with a novel humidification unit. This unique combination leads to very high electrical efficiencies (>40%) as well as a very flexible heat:power ratio. Low emissions are achieved by the application of flameless combustion, and a high GHG emission reduction is obtained by using truly advanced, RED2 compliant biofuel.
Use of a mGT as core-unit in Fit4Micro is ideal for domestic usage, as the system has very low noise output and is vibration free. Furthermore, rapid response times and fuel-flexible operation make this the ideal base for a highly efficient hybrid CHP system, resilient to changes in (local) fuel and power markets, empowering the consumers through digital solutions. Furthermore, the Fit4Micro unit will be integrated with a compression heat pump, an innovative adsorption and a solar PV system through the DC power system avoiding transmission losses. A smart control system will be developed to enable optimal performance at all times. 
Efficient fuel distribution and off-grid operation of Fit4Micro is enabled by using sustainable liquid biofuels. These fuels will be produced from biomass residues and organic waste streams, through fast pyrolysis followed by mild hydro-processing yielding a hydrotreated pyrolysis oil (HPO). In Fit4Micro the objective is to widen the feedstock basis and lower the fuel costs by i) using residues as the primary feedstock, and ii) by limiting hydrogen consumption by application of mild processing conditions.
Besides technological development work, the Fit4Micro project includes specific activities on socio-economic and environmental sustainability, public perception, gender dimensions, market aspects, the regulatory framework & policies."	micro gas turbine; hybrid heating system; adsorption chiller; biofuel; biomass residues; organic wastes	MITIS - MITIS	AALBORG UNIVERSITET - AAU; B.T.G.

Circular fuel supply for air transport via negative emission HTL conversion	"Achieving climate neutrality in Europe requires large volumes of truly sustainable fuels to provide long-term solutions for transport sectors where direct electrification is not viable. CIRCULAIR addresses this challenge with an integrated biofuel pathway that produces cost-effective aviation fuels and generates negative emissions. Key innovations of CIRCULAIR involve a close thermal coupling of hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) conversion, based on abundant and available agricultural residues and lignocellulosic crops, with exothermic wet oxidation of HTL process water. In this way, autothermal operation can be achieved, carbon is fully utilized, and the process water disposal problem of HTL is solved. In addition, CIRCULAIR develops innovative approaches to upgrade HTL biocrudes to jet fuel and accelerates the approval of HTL fuels for civil aviation. The biomass resource utilization is maximized by developing valorisation schemes for all relevant side streams along the process chain. In particular, acetic acid will be extracted from residual process waters and methanol will be synthesized from effluent gas streams and renewable hydrogen. Importantly, CIRCULAIR will close a knowledge gap regarding the utilization of fixed carbon in the HTL solids for carbon sequestration and soil amendment, i.e. for a negative contribution to the carbon balance. The targeted overall net-negative emission will be quantified based on life cycle analysis. Finally, techno- and socio-economic analyses will identify important benefits and trade-offs associated with the advanced biofuel process. 
In summary: CIRCULAIR will investigate and develop an innovative process for resource-efficient production of sustainable aviation biofuels alongside further marketable renewable chemicals and fuel products. The utilization of biomass feedstock that is abundant in agricultural environments ensures cost-efficiency, relevant scale and the potential to create net-negative carbon emissions."	jet fuel; negative emissions; hydrothermal liquefaction; sectorial coupling; renewable hydrogen	BAUHAUS LUFTFAHRT EV -	AALBORG UNIVERSITET - AAU; AARHUS UNIVERSITET - AU	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101083944/program/43108390/details	
Circular design and manufacturing techniques for next-generation highly-efficient integrated axial flux motor drives for electric vehicles	"Electric traction machines are at the heart of the transition towards a zero tailpipe emission road mobility landscape, with their performance and cost directly impacting the attainable market penetration of electric vehicles. To accelerate the transition, next-generation electric motors need to push the existing boundaries in terms of efficiency, power density, manufacturability, cost, and environmental sustainability. A reduced and more circular use of rare earth resources is critical to reinforce Europe’s strategic autonomy and establish a more economically sustainable value chain. Recently developed axial flux motor technology based on a yokeless and segmented armature topology yields promising prospects in all these areas, significantly reducing the required amount of rare earth magnet material by design, and combining this with unmatched power density compared to state-of-the-art radial flux machines.
CliMAFlux will develop novel concepts (e.g., in terms of excitation and cooling) for more performant (e.g., >35% energy loss decrease in driving cycles) axial flux motors, thus reducing the need for rare earth materials by 60%, leveraging high-fidelity multiphysics models (e.g., electromagnetic, thermal, mechanical, and at the system level) and digital twins. Innovative designs and manufacturing processes will be proposed to: (i) increase the power density to >23 kW/l, through novel materials and improved thermal behaviour; (ii) enhance circularity over the lifetime (including >70% recyclability at the end of life); and (iii) ensure cost competitiveness (50% cost reduction) at mass production level (reaching ~€5/kW). The CliMAFlux on-board motors are integrated with the power electronics and mechanical transmission systems. The resulting electric drives will be managed by robust predictive controllers based on the CliMAFlux digital twins, including artificial intelligence (AI) prediction models, which will also facilitate novel functionalities in vehicle (sub)systems, hereby exploiting the full capability of the complete electrified drivetrain. The individual motor (with focus on approx. 90 kW continuous power) and integrated drive system will be benchmarked over a wider range of vehicles, in terms of both performance and environmental impact, on virtual (X-in-the-Loop with digital twin) and hardware test platforms up to TRL7, i.e., on a research electric vehicle already available at the consortium participants. To achieve these ambitious targets, CliMAFlux brings together the competences of 4 academic partners, 1 industry-oriented RTO, 3 SMEs and 1 LE with dedicated R&D and production facilities in the fields of motor and transmission development, power electronics integration, electrified vehicle systems, automotive design, and life cycle assessment and costing aspects.
In summary, CliMAFlux will establish new knowledge and industrial leadership in key digital, enabling and emerging technologies, and, therefore, directly contribute to Europe’s Key Strategic Orientations C and A as well as actively support the transformation towards zero tailpipe emission road mobility (2Zero)."	electric motor; axial flux; circularity; multiphysics design; digital twins; life cycle assessment	UNIVERSITEIT GENT - UGent	BLUEWAYS INTERNATIONAL BVBA - BLUEWAYS; POLITECNICO DI TORINO - POLITO	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101096062/program/43108390/details	
Cardiogenomics meets Artificial Intelligence: a step forward in arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy diagnosis and treatment	"Arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (ACM) is a genetic disease characterized by progressive cardiomyocyte loss and fibrofatty replacement, which in turn lead to the occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death (SCD), particularly in the young and athletes. At present, ACM is uncurable; with an incidence of 1:5000, it can be considered a major CVD disease. The subform involving only the right ventricle is the most common; the majority of its causative mutations are identified in just three desmosomal genes: PKP2, DSP, and DSG2. However, many of the identified variants in these disease genes are still of uncertain clinical significance (VUS) and thus of limited clinical utility. The overall aim of the project is to combine large-scale data from genomics, proteomics and instrumental analysis obtained from patients with data from structural and functional analyses of in vitro (3D microtissue) and in vivo (murine) models, to establish the genotype/cardiac phenotype relationship, potentially leading to a better understanding of the role and impact of known genes and epigenetic factors (ie, miRNAs) on susceptibility, clinical progression, and treatment of ACM.

Carbon Atmospheric Tracer Research to Improve Numerics and Evaluation	The CATRINE project will focus on the atmospheric tracer transport research areas identified by the EU's CO2 Task Force, the CO2 Human Emissions (CHE) project, and the Copernicus CO2 service (CoCO2) projects. The accuracy and mass conservation of the tracer transport model is of utmost importance in the design of the CO2MVS. Any unaccounted systematic errors in the tracer transport model can lead to inaccuracies in the estimation of CO2 and other tracer emissions. Therefore, CATRINE aims to improve the methods used to represent resolved tracer transport by the winds, with a particular focus on mass conservation, and to identify other systematic errors associated with unresolved processes represented by parametrizations. The project will define protocols for evaluating tracer transport models at both global and local scales. Test beds based on field campaign case studies will be developed, along with suitable metrics for tracer transport evaluation, utilising a range of tracers and observations at both global and local scales. These metrics will be employed in the operational CO2MVS to evaluate the implementation of new transport model developments, characterise transport accuracy and representativity in data assimilation, and provide a quality control stamp of tracer transport accuracy. Lastly, CATRINE will provide clear recommendations to the CO2MVS and the Carbon Cycle Community which works with atmospheric inversion models for the evaluation and quality assessment of tracer transport models.	greenhouse gas flux inversions; CO2MVS; atmospheric tracer transport modelling	EUROPEAN CENTRE FOR MEDIUM-RANGE WEATHER FORECASTS - ECMWF		https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101135000/program/43108390/details	
CONtext-aware VerifIable dyNamiC dEliberation	"In recent years, robots are being increasingly deployed outside strictly controlled environments. When faced with unexpected situations, these robots are often incapable of taking appropriate action and require human intervention. The goal of CONVINCE is to advance the capabilities of robots to perform complex tasks robustly and safely within unstructured environments via autonomous and unsupervised adaptation to the environment and operational context.
More specifically, the key contribution is to develop cognitive deliberation capabilities that ensure safe robot operation over extended periods of time without human intervention. These capabilities will be integrated into a model-driven software toolchain to allow developers to build application-specific deliberation systems able to i) determine robot’s behaviors required to fulfill a given task, also taking into account the context in which the robot operates and the experience gained during previous executions of the same task, ii) deploy and configure the components that are required to execute these behaviors, iii) automate the analysis of behaviors to ensure that they are safe and secure, leveraging on formal models and tools for design-time and run-time verification. The toolchain shall be based on proven system modeling concepts, particularly from the EU-funded project RobMoSys. Major parts shall be open-sourced with adapters to relevant robotics frameworks like the Robot Operating System (ROS).
To ensure real-world applicability, CONVINCE will demonstrate the technology developed in the project on three different real-world use cases, each of which presents unique technical difficulties and utilizes robotic systems of increasing complexity, in different application domains: vacuum cleaner robot, assembly robot, and robotic museum guide."

CENTAUR - COPERNICUS ENHANCED TOOLS FOR ANTICIPATIVE RESPONSE TO CLIMATE CHANGE IN THE EMERGENCY AND SECURITY DOMAIN	"Within HORIZON-CL4-2021-SPACE-01-43 - Copernicus Security and Emergency Services evolution, the objective of CENTAUR is to respond to societal challenges deriving from Climate Change threats by developing and demonstrating new service components for the Copernicus Emergency Management Service (CEMS) and Copernicus Service in Support to EU External Action service (SEA), aiming to:

1. Improve situational awareness and preparedness around climate change and its impact on complex emergencies and multi-dimensional (security) crises;
2. Anticipate the occurrence and possible knock-on effects of crisis events, in particular those triggered by climatic extremes, thus contributing to resilience and effective adaptation.

In the emergency domain, CENTAUR will address the flood-related threats to population, assets and infrastructures in urban areas. In the Security domain, CENTAUR will address water & food insecurity. The two work streams will be connected via a cross-cutting component focusing on exposure and vulnerability to climate change, as well as resilience and societal capacity for managing environmental risks and social conflict. Across work streams, indicators and models will be validated by different methods. CENTAUR will integrate data coming from multiple heterogeneous sources, with a specific focus on those generated by other Copernicus services, and, in particular, those of the Climate Change Service). It will combine these with meteorological data, socio-economic data, and data coming from new sensors (e.g. traditional and social media). Thus, it will enhance current capacities to produce composite risk indexes and to perform multi-criteria analyses in the emergency and security domains."

CAPTURING ULTRAFAST ELECTRON AND ION DYNAMICS IN BATTERIES	"Batteries are attractive candidates for lightweight, high capacity, mobile energy storage solutions. Despite decades of research, a persistent fundamental knowledge gap prevents batteries from fulfilling their potential, because the atomistic mechanisms of charge and ion transfer across interfaces in batteries remain largely unexplored by experimental techniques. When charges move, the local arrangement of atoms changes in response to the new electronic configuration. How these changes occur has a significant impact on how efficiently and how far the charges can move, yet the time and length scales are still poorly understood. Conventional experimental probes used in battery research cannot provide the needed ultrafast time and atomic length scale resolution, nor sensitivity to changes in electronic configuration around specific atomic species. Hence, it is currently challenging to unravel the dynamic rearrangement of atoms and ions which accompany electron transfer, and in turn govern the charge transfer processes.

UltraBat will close this knowledge gap by pushing further the latest development of ultra-bright and ultra-fast X-ray Free Electron Laser (XFEL) scattering and spectroscopy techniques together with visible ultrafast spectroscopy to study charge transfer between different redox centres in Li-rich layered intercalation compounds and at the solid/liquid interface. Advances in NMR spectroscopy will reveal local ordering and lithium interfacial dynamics on the nanometer scale. Coupled with predictions of experimental observables from a new framework for atomic-scale simulations of the electrochemical interface and transport mechanisms, we will reveal phenomena driving diffusion of ions in complex electrode materials. This will provide the insight required for transformational approaches to control the redox reactions (e.g. electron transfer) that are common to many energy-related processes, including batteries, photovoltaics, and water-splitting systems."

Breaking the Resolution Limit in Two-Photon Microscopy Using Negative Photochromism	"Multiphoton microscopy is a benchmark tool in biomedical research, used for the fluorescence imaging in cellular environments. This has important implications for disease diagnosis and the monitoring of therapy response. In conventional two-photon microscopy the fluorescence intensity of the employed molecular probe is proportional to the square of the excitation light intensity, implying that the fluorescence from the sample is confined around the focal point, yielding good spatial resolution. The spatial resolution can be dramatically improved by drawing on higher-order processes such as four-photon absorption. However, its practical implementation imposes major technical challenges, such as extreme laser intensities in the deep NIR. For this reason four-photon microscopy has so far attracted academic interest only.

The present proposal addresses this issue and provides a multidisciplinary answer to the question: Can we develop a technique that offers spatial resolution of four-photon microscopy, but relies on two-photon absorption? This would combine the upsides of two-photon microscopy (low excitation energies provided by standard lasers at around 800 nm, high penetration depth in tissue) with the superior spatial resolution of four-photon microscopy. The result would be nothing less than a true paradigm shift in multiphoton microscopy. The key to tackle this highly ambitious task lies in the design of molecules that combine two mechanistically entangled two-photon processes (4for2) for the generation of a fluorescence output. This is possible by merging two-photon absorption, two-photon FRET-induced photoisomerization, and negative photochromism. Purposefully designed switchable fluorophores, that unify these photophysical assets, will be developed and their performance will be critically validated in a multi-angle spectroscopic work-flow, including the demonstration in application-relevant biological environments."

Boosting SUstaiNability, Reliability and EfficiencY of perovskite PV through novel materials and process engineering.	"Perovskite photovoltaics have seen rapid advances in the last decade with the promise of higher efficiency, reduced embedded energy and CO2 emissions, low-temperature production for versatile applications such as flexible photovoltaics and all at potentially much lower cost than current Si technology. However, poor stability and short lifetime in the field is holding back wide deployment of perovskite photovoltaics. The current best performing materials also contain lead (Pb) which is toxic and damaging to health and the environment.

To address these limitations, SUNREY will tackle the root causes of these limiting factors through a suite of innovations covering all aspects of the device design and manufacture including improvements to the stability/performance ratio of the perovskite materials themselves, development of new charge transport and electrode materials and low-cost deposition methods that can be configured to different perovskite absorbers, development of improved stability Pb-free materials, development of a range of measures for barriers and encapsulation from layers to module and process optimisation. These technology developments will be underpinned by new approaches to degradation mechanism analysis and the incorporation of modelling to combine barrier properties data with device performance models and test data. The design process will be driven by lifecycle, circularity and sustainability analyses. Developments will be validated to TRL5 through testing by an accredited laboratory under both realistic laboratory conditions and outdoors.

SUNREY targets a breakthrough combination of high efficiency (25% Pb-based, 15% Pb-free) with long lifetime (25 years), reduced emissions and cost of manufacturing compared to Si. This will open up a wide range of new opportunities for the consortium companies including utility-scale panels, IoT and MicroPower, Independent Power Sources, Building Applied Utility Power (BAPV) Building-Integrated Photovoltaics."

Bone Marrow-on-Chip as smart sensor of lung cancer relapse	"In the past 40 years the overall survival rate for people affected by tumors has doubled, with about 50% of patients now surviving their disease for 10 years or more. Nonetheless, some cancers (e.g lung cancer) still have poor survival rate. A major cause of lung cancer mortality is represented by disease relapse, occuring when few of the original cancer cells survive the initial treatment and causing primary tumor recurrence. Currently, no options are available to predict the risk of lung cancer relapse, which is only diagnosed late based on radiological evidence. Hence, the ability to early detect lung cancer relapse represents an urgent and unmet need, since a fast and tailored treatment could dramatically increase patients’ survival rate.
BuonMarrow lays on the groundbreaking hypothesis, supported by our Consortium preliminary clinical evidence, that bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (BM-MSC) may be educated upon cancer mediators exposure, and acquire a long-term memory-like response which is amplified when exposed to a secondary tumor. Owing to breakthrough technologies available in the Consortium (organ-on-chip, innovative optical sensors and biological modeling of the bone marrow niche), BuonMarrow partners will develop an in vitro miniaturized bone marrow device able to harness the amplified BM-MSC response generated by liquid biopsy of lung cancer patients, thus acting as a biological sensor for the early detection of relapse. A combination of retrospective and prospective clinical studies, respectively, will allow to calibrate and validate such sensor, delivering an unprecedented tool to assist the decision-making process on lung cancer patients.
We expect to significantly improve oncological treatments, building on a personalized medicine approach to increased patient survival and well-being, and thereby deeply impacting on EU’s socio/economic environment."	organ-on-chip; lung cancer relapse; bone marrow niche; tissue engineering; biosensors	POLITECNICO DI MILANO - POLIMI		https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101130604/program/43108390/details	
Biosensor-Based Diagnostic Platform Enabling Real-Time Monitoring of Existing and Emerging Pollutants	BIOSENSEI develops a real-time, multiplexed, end-to-end, tailored and reliable biosensor platform, using cellular responses, for detection of abiotic pollutants - Nutrients, Estrogenic endocrine-disrupting chemicals, and PFAS (Perfluoroalkyl and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances); and biotic pollutants - Microcystins. Cellular biosensors from bacterial variants will be genetically engineered using, RNA-RNA interactive and type III CRISPR-Cas-mediated transduction cascades. These biosensors are encapsulated and immobilised at bi-modal transducers (nanoelectrochemical and optical) to provide highly reliable, tuneable and sensitive detection of the target pollutants. Bespoke ultra-low power analog front ends and autonomous IoT end-nodes will enable operation and data acquisition from biosensors and facilitate easy integration in existing LoRa networks enabling real-time data feeds. Neural computing algorithms are embedded on the edge to correct for sensor aging and interferents in the (bio)chemical transduction and improve sensor data accuracy. An online dashboard will be developed to allow end users to visualize data. BIOSENSEI will embed the whole R&D process within a safe-and-sustainable-by-design framework to guarantee environmental safety related to risks of potential release into the open environment. Biosensors will be scalable, adaptable to different applications in water & soil and will be deployed in four different use-cases. The consortium is vertically integrated bringing expertise in cellular biology, surface chemistry, nanoelectronics fabrication, hardware integration, regulatory and industrial sampling and artificial intelligence. BIOSENSEI directly addresses HORIZON-CL6-2023-ZEROPOLLUTION-01-6 Biosensors and user-friendly diagnostic tools for environmental services and will allow cellular biosensors to be deployed outside laboratory settings for the first time the project and has the potential to considerably contribute to fulfil EU vision on zero-pollution.

Biophotonic Nanoparticle-enabled Laser Blood Test for Early Detection of Pancreatic Cancer	Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a deadly form of cancer  that is on the rise due to various factors, including an aging population and unhealthy lifestyles. Regrettably, PDAC is among the top cancer killers, with a dismal five-year survival rate of less than 10%. The lack of adequate screening programs is a significant factor contributing to this dire statistic. However, the identification of PDAC in its early stages could help reduce the mortality rate by as much as 80%. The project LASERBLOOD (Biophotonic Nanoparticle-enabled Laser Blood Test for Early Detection of Pancreatic Cancer) aims to develop an in vitro diagnostic test based on the fluorescence lifetime fingerprint of the personalized protein corona, offering critical information at every stage of PDAC progression. The protein corona (PC) is a coating of bio-molecular substances surrounding nanoparticles when exposed to biofluids. It is both personalized and disease-specific, making it an ideal marker to monitor the variation of nanoparticle PC and correlate it to the development of PDAC. The analysis will use fluorescence lifetime (FL) analysis, a non-invasive, reactant-free, and real-time technique. In the initial phase, the consortium will utilize a mouse model (MKC) to identify the FL fingerprint of protein corona at each stage of PDAC development. The MKC mouse model is genetically engineered to be bioluminescent and develop PDAC in a controlled manner. By linking the development of PDAC observed through bioluminescent imaging to the FL response of PC in blood samples, the consortium will provide an unprecedented fingerprint of the disease's progression from its first occurrence. At a second stage, the project will validate on humans the use of the FL fingerprint of protein corona as a tool for the early diagnosis of PDAC. The findings will provide the scientific and technological foundation for the development of an in vitro PDAC test for large scale screening of the population.	pancreatic cancer; early diagnosis; fluorescence lifetime; nanoparticles; protein corona; oncology	FLIM LABS SRL - FLIM LABS	CROWDHELIX LIMITED -; FONDAZIONE POLICLINICO UNIVERSITARIO CAMPUS BIO MEDICO -	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101130740/program/43108390/details	
Biomarkers affecting the transition from cardiovascular disease to lung cancer: towards stratified interception.	Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and lung cancer (LC) are leading causes of deaths and intertwined chronic inflammatory processes associated with metabolism reprogramming, clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP), intestinal dysbiosis, and maladaptive immunity. CVD prone-tobacco users exhibit a 1-2% yearly incidence of LC. Low dose computed tomography screening programs reduce LC mortality by 20%. Beyond epidemiological scores, risk identification, early cancer detection and interception are mostly based on cell autonomous approaches. Understanding pathophysiological failures linking CVD to LC would allow to take steps for prevention. Based on metabolo-metageno-proteo-immuno-gen-omics, our PREVALUNG prospective study conducted in CVD tobacco consumers allowed to unveil four drivers of early carcinogenesis leading to actionable biomarkers that can be harnessed to pioneer personalized interceptive measures. Four main objectives will be harnessed by 7 academic partners (transdisciplinarity and trialists in interception), 3 diagnostic Biotech Cies and one nutrition Foundation. First, refine and validate in retro- and pro-spective cohorts (>60.000), the 4 classifiers relying on the 4 inflammatory drivers (autophagy/innate immunity/intestinal barrier  defects and CHIP) to implement patient stratification. Second, develop and validate robust friendly-user tools monitoring such biomarkers for routine risk assessment. Third, demonstrate the actionability of these biomarkers through a biologically-informed multi-arm randomised trial testing measures targeting each of the 4 main drivers of inflammation using food supplements or pharmacological agents (metformin, anti-NKG2A/PDL-1 Abs, IL-1 inhibitor, probiotics respectively) in addition to diet and life-style changes to return to homeostasis. Fourth, to adapt a secured interface between patients and clinical researchers using these new tools to the longitudinal monitoring of the interceptive measures.

Biointelligent Production Sensor to Measure Viral Activity	We aim to transform virus biomanufacturing processes and enable new quality control strategies by a continuous, real-time capable biohybrid sensor technology to detect cell-based virus infection cycles. BioProS sensor concept makes use of an optical sensor technology in combination with cell-based measurement principles. In this context a platform technology will be developed that can be adapted to multiple specific analytes which enables its applicability in different industries and production settings. The development of such platform technology together with its technological complexity requires the involvement of multiple stakeholders throughout Europe and across disciplines (biology, engineering science, data science, manufacturing experts). Digitalisation has to extend from the very beginning of the process into the whole manufacturing chain, utilising all advances achieved in smart and lot-size-one manufacturing in recent years. This leads to the closely intertwined interaction of technical, informational and biological systems also referred to as bio-intelligent systems. This new paradigm opens up a large new space for innovations, recognised as a strategic field in America, Asia and Europe. Based on the manufacturing excellence leadership of Europe, BioProS will significantly contribute to all expected impacts of the Destination “Digital and Emerging Technologies” and explicitly to each of the four expected outcomes of this call topic. The consortium aims to gather all required expertise and set the basis for international partnerships. In close cooperation with pan-European initiatives and with the support of an industry advisory board, project partners aim to transform the vision of bio-intelligent manufacturing and demonstrate the applicability of disruptive technologies in an industrial setting. We will promote the research community for bio-intelligent methods and applications worldwide, and at the same time create technology sovereignty for Europe.	bio-intelligent; biomanufacturing; decentralized production; viral vector production; process control; bioprinting; in-line monitoring; digital sensor; sustainability; cell and gene therapy	FRAUNHOFER GESELLSCHAFT ZUR FORDERUNG DER ANGEWANDTEN FORSCHUNG EV - Fraunhofer	BICO GROUP AB - BICO GROUP; CELLINK BIOPRINTING AB -	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101070120/program/43108390/details	
Biointegrable soft actuators alimented by metabolic energy	State-of-the art implantable actuating devices, such as automated prosthetics, have time-limited operational capacities because they are sustained by batteries which, ultimately, rely on external power sources to be recharged. INTEGRATE proposes a radically new way to solve this problem: use metabolic energy from the patient to power implanted devices. To achieve this ambitious goal, INTEGRATE will develop i) new 3D printable soft actuating materials inspired by human muscles whit high performances and low power consumption and ii) an artificial organ capable of harvesting metabolic (biochemical) energy and transform it into electricity. The actuating materials (Bionic Muscles) will be prepared via self-assembly of  biocompatible colloidal liquid crystals and stimuli-responsive polymers. A modular design and 3D printability will offer the possibility to manufacture these materials on the basis of patient’s anatomy and needs. The Energy-Harvesting Organ will be capable of converting pH differences within various body fluids (e.g. gastric juice and saliva) in electricity with high efficiency, providing the necessary power to sustain the Bionic Muscles. This research will revolutionize the field of implantable devices and will represent a turning point in robotics, wearable technologies, materials science, energy conversion, and materials engineering.	artificial muscles; bionics; energy-autonomous prosthetics	VELTHA IVZW - VELTHA	CENTRE NATIONAL DE LA RECHERCHE SCIENTIFIQUE CNRS - CNRS; TECHNISCHE UNIVERSITEIT EINDHOVEN - TU/e	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101046333/program/43108390/details	
BioFunctional IntraNeural Electrodes	BioFunctional IntraNeural Electrodes : In BioFINE we will develop flexible intraneural multielectrode arrays, capable of interfacing peripheral nerves e.g. to transfer input/output signals from bionic limbs. Specifically, we address the challenge of long term tissue integration and chronic stability, by addressing three aspects of biocompatibility: 1) We develop novel fabrication methods allowing the intraneural interface to be defined at even finer resolution than before; 2) we explore functionalizations which will control the tissue response by combined surface anchored and surface eluted agents; 3) we address structural biocompatibility on a system level by engineering novel implantable interconnects which reduced tethering forces and improve prospects for high channel count interfaces. Fine-tuned bioactivity will safe-guard surrounding neural tissue in the initial stages of healing, and implants of sub-cellular dimensions and tissue compatible biomechanics, will safe-guard tissue healthy in the longer term. The combined approach will offer optimal conditions to bridge the gap from electrode to neuron and generate a long term functional peripheral nerve interface. Indeed, each of the three technological advancements would on their own have substantial impact on neurotechnology, reaching far beyond intraneural interfaces.

Better Contrails Mitigation	"Aviation contributes to about 5% of the total anthropogenic climate change when including non-CO2 effects, e.g., contrail formation and the impact of NOx emissions on ozone and methane.  Among various non-CO2 effects, the contrail-cirrus radiative forcing is the largest (~2/3) with large uncertainties. The most critical affecting factor is the huge weather-induced variability of the radiative impact of individual contrails. This is the quantity, BeCoM will predict better since the knowledge of the individual radiative forcing is the basis for avoidance of just those contrails that contribute most to the overall climate impact. Once this is standard, it will be possible to formulate adequate mitigation measures and develop policy-driven implementation schemes. 
BeCoM will address the uncertainties related to the forecasting of persistent contrails and their weather-dependent individual radiative effects. BeCoM focuses on: 1) obtaining a larger and higher resolution database of relative humidity and ice supersaturation at cruise levels for assimilation into numerical weather prediction (NWP) models; 2) providing more adequate representation of ice clouds in their supersaturated environment in the NWP models; and 3) validation of the predictions to determine and reduce the remaining uncertainties of contrail forecasts. To facilitate the assimilation and validation process, BeCoM will develop a novel hybrid artificial intelligence algorithm. Based on the contrail prediction, BeCoM will develop a policy framework for effective contrail avoidance through a trajectory optimization approach. BeCoM will enable a better understanding of contrail’s climate impact and formulate recommendations on how to implement strategies to enable air traffic management to reduce aviation's climate impact. The BeCoM consortium builds on its knowledge and expertise covering a wide spectrum from atmospheric science and climate research to aviation operations research and policy development."	non-CO2 climate impact; operational measurements; ice cloud physics; hybrid-AI assisted assimilation and contrail detection; trajectory optimization; policy-driven flight planning	TECHNISCHE UNIVERSITEIT DELFT - TU Delft	CENTRE NATIONAL DE LA RECHERCHE SCIENTIFIQUE CNRS - CNRS; DEUTSCHER WETTERDIENST - DWD	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101056885/program/43108390/details	
BIOmimetic selective extraction MEMbranes	"The ability to selectively extract compounds from waters will transform a multitude of applications, ranging from high-value compound isolation in industrial bioprocesses to removal of pollutants from the environment. However, current filtration technologies are reliant on physicochemical separation strategies requiring high pressure/energy inputs and cannot discriminate specific molecules. BIOMEM will develop novel biomimetic membranes harnessing the unique selectivity of biological transport proteins to facilitate the extraction of single compounds with exquisite specificity. 
Our concept is to use the unique antiport characteristics of secondary active transport proteins, to move molecules, even at low concentrations, across a polymer membrane against their concentration gradient, deriving energy from the transport of another readily available ion down its own concentration gradient. A novel group of bifunctional polymers will be used to extract membrane proteins, together with their associated lipids, into nanoscale discs. These will then be embedded into polymer membranes which are otherwise impermeable to create membranes that are completely selective for the compound of interest. These bio-inspired membranes will be characterised to understand organisation and function of the membrane,  to allow design and optimisation for custom compounds. The produced membranes will be tested for functionality in a proof-of-concept experiment to extract complex high-value oligosaccharides from bulk biomass and phosphate from wastewaters. 
While initially focussing on those two applications, the separation technology developed will evidence the potential for “plug and play”, bespoke, selective membranes capable of transporting specific molecules through existing or bio-engineered transporters. The developed membranes will be fully scalable and operate at rates comparable to state-of-the-art nanofiltration devices, while simultaneously requiring around 50-75% less energy."

BAYesian Inference with FLEXible electronics for biomedical Applications	The long term vision in BAYFLEX is to create a radically new technology that uses low cost, green organic electronics for probabilistic computing in order to allow continuous and private monitoring of bio-signals on flexible substrates. The vision of flexible green AI sensors with on chip classification extends well beyond biomedical devices and the democratization of health care, with the possibility to transform sensor data at the edge of large networks. To achieve our goal, BAYFLEX will demonstrate a patch using active physiological sensors based on organic materials that interface with the soft human body and that also includes classification circuits (~ 100 transistors) fabricated using Thin Organic Large Area Electronics (TOLAE) processes. These circuits use spiking neurons realized in Organic Thin Film Transistors (OTFTs) to transform the non-stationary electrical signals from the sensors into stochastic bit streams. Bayesian inference is then used to classify the data using circuits of cascaded Muller C-elements. Taking advantage of the unique properties of organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs), low transistor count dynamic Muller C-elements are targeted. The patch will be tested on a simple task using healthy humans. The project brings together an interdisciplinary consortium with expertise in modeling emerging devices, biologically inspired circuit design, experts in machine learning involving electrophysiological data (including an SME) and teams with expertise in OTFT and OECT fabrication. BAYFLEX targets dissemination to a variety of publics including: scientists via publications in (open access) high impact journals and conferences; industrials and end-users through an industrial advisory board, a workshop and demonstrations at targeted conferences; the general public with the creation of a transferable workshop for non-scientific communities and training the next generation of experts through specialized schools and workshops.

It is based on a toolset of innovative and state-of-the-art characterisation methods for multiscale materials, interoperable tests, and analytical models supported by and linked through machine learning. With this, the production costs, materials waste, and the CO2 footprint in production lines will be reduced, while in parallel the battery electrochemical performance at the single cell level will be increased. The new measurement tools and multi-scale modelling algorithms lead to a higher characterisation speed (factor of 5) and an improved accuracy in cell tests by an order of magnitude, as will be demonstrated on the lab bench and in pilot lines.

Being 100% biological, BABots are highly compatible with the natural environment, self-producible, and fully degradable. They will also be agile and highly sensitive to surrounding signals. To control BABot behavior, we will genetically insert specific new synaptic connections and synthetic gene circuits in C. elegans to produce artificial aggregation, dynamic sensorimotor switching and other functional building blocks. To ensure a safe and controlled deployment, we will genetically implement a multi-layered biocontainment apparatus. To gain tighter control over the BABot collective behavior, we will exploit heterogeneity in the population, blending, for example, leader and follower BABots, based on their differential access to information. The science behind this innovative technology includes a synthetic neurobiological approach to modifying individual worm behavior, the study of collective behavior in engineered worms, and the development of a theory of heterogeneity-based swarm control. We also dedicate a substantial effort to establish a firm and effective safety, ethical and regulatory framework, under which current and future BABots can be developed. This project will generate a radically new approach to bio-robotics that could contribute to precision agriculture, industry and medicine. Improving over a previous proposal, we significantly enhanced (i) the methodology, (ii) the safety and ethical aspects, and (iii) the demonstration and exploitation by implementation in an agricultural setting.

B-specific: B-cell related gene and protein markers with prognostic and therapeutic value for CVD	Atherosclerosis is the major underlying condition of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and one the leading causes of mortality. Rupture or erosion of atherosclerotic lesions can lead to acute cardiovascular events, such as myocardial infarction and stroke, making biomarkers to diagnose patients at risk for these events and develop tailored preventive interventions, an urgent need. Although atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease, clinical investigation of the adaptive immune system as a potential rheostat for disease development has been limited. The B-specific consortium aims to classify and mitigate risk of CVD by generating novel types of genetic data and defining novel prognostic and therapeutic targets attained from our recent discovery of a specific B-cell subset. We will employ state-of-the-art technology, including single cell RNA sequencing, BCR repertoire analysis and mass spectrometry-based identification of autoantigens in CVD patient material. With access to large population-based cohorts (FIMCOD, ERGO Study) spanning healthy adults of 40-105 years of age, we aim to assess the prognostic value of circulating B cell subsets and antibodies in (sub)clinical atherosclerosis and investigate the contribution of genetic disposition. Using the extensive genomics data of the ERGO Study, we will be able to determine causal links between the prognostic indicators and disease progression by applying Mendelian Randomization experiments and confirm these relationships in ex vivo and in vivo models of atherosclerosis. Based on these findings, B-specific aims to develop at least 1 proof-of-concept therapy targeting specific B cells. B-specific will implement an active open science platform and in combination with a targeted dissemination approach to healthcare professionals, we aim to impact cardiology practice and provide important new means of patient stratification and treatment options.

Autonomous Living Cell analYsis ON-chip for Evaluation of space Environment Effects: low-power integrated lab-on-chip for the assessment of radiation damage on living systems in nanosatellite missions	"The project aims at the design and realization of a new analytical platform implementing a series of innovative technologies able to provide a highly-integrated solution for the analysis in-situ of the effects of the space environment on model biological systems and for the evaluation of shielding technologies combined with radioprotective agents. The main objective of the project will be achieved through the development of a lab-on-chip device with integrated thin-film sensors and actuators that will implement an extremely compact cell-incubator capable to sample the status of the cell culture during a space mission using real-time monitoring techniques based on bioluminescence. Genetically modified microorganisms will be designed in order to monitor specific stress responses based on a luciferase-based reporter system. An electronic system will be integrated in the platform for the characterization of the radiation environment allowing  to evaluate the correlation between observed biological effects and radiation exposure.
The main features of the proposed technology include low power consumption, extreme compactness, high data efficiency and full automation making it suitable for cubesat missions. In particular, a complete cubesat payload will be designed to address and solve any integration issue and to provide a test bench for a preliminary set of experiments to be carried out on ground facilities simulating the deep space environment. The proposed system will therefore represent a key element to pave the route toward deep space human mission as it offers the possibility to test the effects of long term exposure to the space environment on model biological systems using simple platforms as cubesats. This opens new scenarios where minor effort
will be required to plan multiple low-cost missions for improving the risk modeling and for testing new countermeasures in a continuous-improvement scheme."	lab-on-chip; integrated thin-film devices; biosensor; bioluminescence; cell incubator; space environment effects; radiation damage; dosimetry; cubesat; nanosatellites	UNIVERSITA DEGLI STUDI DI ROMA LA SAPIENZA - UNIROMA1	ALMA MATER STUDIORUM - UNIVERSITA DI BOLOGNA - UNIBO; KARLSRUHER INSTITUT FUER TECHNOLOGIE - KIT	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101082679/program/43108390/details	
Automatics in Space Exploration	"A critical need for the future of space exploration is the ability to run artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms in situ under the harsh conditions of space. In recent years AI has been revolutionising industrial processes and everyday activities primarily because the computing power has reached a level that enables these algorithms to function. On the ground this is primarily due to the enormous investments in the development of high-performance graphical processing units (GPU) and of the optimised software needed for them. These are delicate devices that cannot be deployed in the harsh conditions of space and the transistor density of the components of a GPU would be too extreme to resist the radiations present in space. 
 
ASAP takes on the task of using processors that can sustain the radiation environment of space to transfer to space operation AI algorithms that so far could only be run on the ground. ASAP will use the most advanced space-hardiness proven processors and develop the software needed to run AI algorithms on them. ASAP will show proof of principle functionality and will reach TRL-4.
 
ASAP focuses on five goals: 1) Working towards the identification and implementation of Machine Learning algorithms for the next generation space applications: a suite of candidate algorithms has been identified and will be evaluated during the project for their possible deployment to space; 2) Identification and development of a computing platform for ML algorithms producing a prototype hardware using only components that can operate under space conditions; 3) Definition of a validation plan and its execution in a laboratory validation campaign reaching TRL-4; 4) Implementation of a virtual environment to provide support to the development of ML algorithms; 5) Transforming the future development of technologies and scientific instrumentation  for space science and exploration missions bringing artificial intelligence to space missions."	space exploration; artificial intelligence (AI) in space; space-ready computing processors for AI.

Artificial PHOTOsynthesis to produce FUELs and chemicals: hybrid systems with microorganisms for improved light harvesting and CO2 reduction	The Photo2Fuel project will develop a breakthrough technology that converts CO2 into useful fuels and chemicals by means of non-photosynthetic microorganisms and organic materials, using only sunlight as energy source. Photo2Fuel's technology is based on the artificial photosynthesis concept and will use a hybrid system of non-photosynthetic microorganisms and organic photosensitisers to produce acetic acid and methane, using Moorella thermoacetica (bacteria) and Methanosarcina barkeri (archaea) strains, respectively. After optimisation and characterisation, this hybrid non-photosynthetic microorganisms with organic photosensitiser system will be placed into an auto sufficient photo-micro-reactor running exclusively with sunlight. During the day, the natural sunlight will be used, and, during the night, artificial light will be used from previous stored solar energy in batteries (excess sunlight). This approach will guarantee the continuous operation of the photo-micro-reactor. Additionally, a solar concentrator will be coupled to the reactor to maximise conversion and stabilise the production of fuels and chemicals, even with variant solar flux. The Photo2Fuel project will also investigate technologies for the separation of the main products - acetic acid and methane – and deliver solutions to achieve high separation efficiency. The overall sustainability of the Photo2Fuel's technology will be analysed, including the environmental, economic, and social aspects. Lastly, the market, barriers, and key stakeholders will be analysed from an end-user perspective, aiming at advancing the technology's TRL-4 after the project completion and, thus, actively supporting the transition to a climate neutral Europe by 2050. 	solar energy; bacteria; archaea; solar fuels; CO2 reduction; organic semiconductor; solar fuels; artificial photosynthesis; mini-solar plant; products separation; acetic acid; methane; energy storage	IDENER RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT AGRUPACION DE INTERES ECONOMICO - IDENER RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT AIE	FUNDACION TECNALIA RESEARCH & INNOVATION - TECNALIA; Hochschule für angewandte Wissenschaften Landshut - HAW Landshut	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101069357/program/43108390/details	
Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning for Enhanced Representation of Processes and Extremes in Earth System Models	"Global warming continues at an alarming rate, presenting unprecedented challenges to society that require urgent, science-led mitigation and adaptation. Earth system models (ESMs) are essential tools for projecting climate change, providing important information to decision makers. However, confidence in predicted climate change is undermined by a number of uncertainties; (i) ESMs disagree on how much the Earth will warm for a given increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) (Earth’s equilibrium climate sensitivity); (ii) how much emitted CO2 will stay in the atmosphere to warm the planet (half the CO2 emitted by humans has been absorbed by the land and ocean) and (iii) how much excess heat in the Earth system will enter the ocean interior, delaying surface warming (~90 % of the heat in the Earth system goes into the ocean). Central to these uncertainties are poorly understood, and poorly modelled, Earth system feedbacks, in particular cloud feedbacks, carbon cycle feedbacks and ocean heat uptake. Poor representation of these phenomena degrades the accuracy of ESM projections, with implications for anticipating future climate extremes and societal impacts. We aim to improve the representation of these feedbacks in ESMs, reducing uncertainty in global warming projections. We propose a multidisciplinary approach, focused on “learning” how to accurately describe processes underpinning these feedbacks, through a fusion of observations with advanced machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI). Such data and approaches, constrained by the laws of physics, will deliver a step change in the accuracy of Earth system models. 
AI4PEX will place Europe at the forefront of a revolution in Earth system modelling, leading to increased accuracy of climate change projections and superior support for implementation of the Paris Climate Agreement and the European Green Deal."

Artificial Intelligence Guided Develpment of Vanillin-based Flow Batteries	The Grand Challenge ahead is to shift fossil-dominated centralized energy systems towards regenerative integrated multi-vector grids. This requires also sustainable electrical energy storage, including the related raw material supply, processes and systems. A real impact on economy, society and ecology is only created if materials, processes and products can be potentially transferred to large scale. This represents a particular challenge for mid to long term, systems-integrated energy storage, also because the EU strongly depends on critical raw materials from politically instable regions. In VanillaFlow, we develop radically new approaches for integrated energy storage which combine artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) with flow battery technology to replace currently employed, non-sustainable, and critical raw materials (i.e. redox-active molecules, membranes) in flow batteries by readily-available renewable materials based on starch and lignocellulosics. VanillaFlow will use AI and ML techniques such as physics-informed modeling, causal discovery, and representation learning, and makes use of deep learning and symbolic regression. These approaches are used in designing redox active quinones, and to optimize their interplay with the other components of a battery on single and multi-cell level. The whole research will be guided by toxicology investigations to ensure that sustainable and inherently safe materials will be obtained in the project. Today, the innovation capacity of European scientists and industry in the area of renewable materials makes them already the leading global players in the field. VanillaFlow will further support the European technological leadership in the area by cross-fertilization of different fields (artificial intelligence, battery technology, pulp and paper, biotechnology, polymer technology, toxicity) while addressing needs of sustainable materials in mid to long term energy storage.

Aquatic Pollution from Light and Anthropogenic Noise: management of impacts on biodiversity	Recent decades have seen dramatic increases in our understanding of Light and Noise Pollution (LNP) impacts on aquatic biodiversity. These impacts are globally widespread and occurring in all aquatic ecosystems from lakes and rivers to the seafloor. A variety of technologies and policy interventions are also now available to mitigate LNP impacts in aquatic ecosystems. Yet, numerous knowledge gaps exist that if addressed would substantially improve our understanding of the prevalence and impacts of LNP, and our ability to manage them. There remain critical gaps in our understanding of the combined occurrence and impacts of LNP across the breadth of aquatic ecosystems, particularly at large spatial scales and over long-time frames. While numerous abatement options exist, pathways to achieving their effective implementation remain unclear. AquaPLAN is an interdisciplinary pan-European consortium that are world leaders in the fields of aquatic light and/or noise pollution.  AquaPLAN aims to quantify the combined impacts of LNP on aquatic biodiversity across European seas, lakes and rivers, and facilitate the implementation of empirically sound strategies for managing these pollutants through novel interdisciplinary approaches. AquaPLAN will: i) provide a comprehensive review of the state of the art on the impacts of LNP on aquatic biodiversity; ii) assess perceptions of LNP impacts and the need for their management across key stakeholder groups; iii) quantify the combined impacts of LNP on the conservation status of biodiversity in aquatic habitats; iv) identify the mechanisms leading to individual and combined impacts of LNP on aquatic biodiversity; v) explore innovative interdisciplinary solutions to prevent and mitigate LNP impacts on aquatic biodiversity; vi) build an international, interdisciplinary network to assess, prevent and mitigate the combined impacts of LNP on aquatic biodiversity.

Application Aware, Life-Cycle Oriented Model-Hardware Co-Design Framework for Sustainable, Energy Efficient ML Systems	AI is increasingly becoming a significant factor in the CO2 footprint of the European economy.  To avoid a conflict between sustainability and economic competitiveness and to allow the European economy to leverage AI for its leadership in a climate friendly way, new technologies to reduce the energy requirements of all parts of AI system are needed. A key problem is the fact that tools (e.g. PyTorch) and methods that currently drive the rapid spread and democratization of AI prioritize performance and functionality while paying little attention to the CO2 footprint. As a consequence, we see rapid growth in AI applications, but not much so in AI applications that are optimized for low power and sustainability. To change that we aim to develop an interactive design framework and associated models, methods and tools that will foster energy efficiency throughout the whole life-cycle of ML applications: from the design and exploration phase that includes exploratory iterations of training, testing and optimizing different system versions through the final training of the production systems (which often involves huge amounts of data, computation and epochs) and (where appropriate) continuous online re-training during deployment for the inference process. The framework will optimize the ML solutions based on the application tasks, across levels from hardware to model architecture. AI developers from all experience levels will be able to make use of the framework through its emphasis on human-centric interactive transparent design and functional knowledge cores, instead of the common blackbox and fully automated optimization approaches in AutoML.  The framework will be made available on the AI4EU platform and disseminated through close collaboration with initiatives such as the ICT 48 networks. It will also be directly exploited by the industrial partners representing various parts of the relevant value chain: from software framework, through hardware to AI services.

Ammonia and MOF Based Hydrogen storagE for euRope	AMBHER (Ammonia and MOF based Hydrogen for Europe) is a European project providing a holistic approach to tackle the short and long term energy storage challenges raised by the high degree of electrification our society is aiming for. Firstly, AMBHER is addressing the main societal, economic and technological questions coming together with the use of green ammonia as seasonal renewable energy storage. Simultaneously, AMBHER is developing and demonstrating innovative and cheaper compressed hydrogen storage potentially solving the gap toward local and economically relevant power-to-hydrogen hub. AMBHER will thus increase the number of applications in the energy and transport sectors and the possibilities for success and industrial adoption by key players. For short-term hydrogen storage, novel nanoporous MOFs (Metal Organic Frameworks) of high surface area (>2.500 m2/g) and low cost synthesis will be developed following an original shaping process (3D printing). Furthermore, AMBHER will develop a conformable cryo-vessel that can accommodate stacks of MOF bodies of tailored-made shape. A capacity of 40g/L of usable space at 100 bar is achieved at competitive cost with respect to current high pressure cylinders (600-1.000 euros/kg H2). For long-term storage, advanced materials (both catalysts and membranes) and their combination in an intensified 3D-printed intensified periodic open cell structured reactor will be developed to allow hydrogen storage in the form of ammonia (NH3) in a cost-efficient and resource-effective process at lower temperatures and pressures compared to conventional systems. AMBHER project is validating both short-term and long term solutions at TRL 5 addressing the positioning of the solutions developed in relevant business cases. The project is built around 16 industry and academic leaders in Europe, from 7 different countries. Track record of AMBHER partners proves the synergies and fruitful collaborative nature among all members.

Alliance for Modelling Industries towards the Green Deal’s objectives And circuLArity	"The objective of the European Green Deal policy is to be climate-neutral by 2050. However, the key problem of the industry transition towards climate neutrality is that the combined response of demand, global trade and industrial production to policy measures is highly complex.
The aim of the AMIGDALA project is to facilitate decision makers in governments and in the EU’s industries to define and evaluate pathways towards climate neutrality, circularity and sustainability. In this project we combine insights in decision-making with integrated modelling of scenarios to analyze transformation pathways. 
We analyze decisions-making in government and in industry by the control options that they have such as incentives, regulatory measures and investments in capital projects to contribute to the Green Deal’s objectives. 
We deliver an integrated model to represent EU industry’s transformation pathways up to 2070 and cover historical developments from 1990. We develop a method to combine established models of separate domains and let them operate as-one. This integrated model shows the combined effect of control options on economy, trade, energy, materials flow, biomass and industrial production on an EU systems-level and within a global context. On a local-level we use models to analyze the decisions by industry clusters to invest in transformative solutions and utility operators to build infrastructure. 
With the integrated model we run scenarios that we develop on the basis of the control options of decisionmakers to achieve industrial transformation towards climate neutrality. The integrated model allows to analyze the effect of framework conditions on the uptake of transformative solutions and products and on energy demand, emissions, and material use.

Aerospace Composites digitally sensorised from manufacturing to end-of-life	INFINITE aims to develop sensors and analyser based on the usage of ferromagnetic microwires to be embedded in aerospace composite structural parts, in order to monitor manufacturing and structural health throughout the whole life cycle of the component. The wireless monitoring system will permit producing digital signals and vast sets of data linked with the specimen to create an as-built digital twin of the structure that will also account for the whole history since it was manufactured through all maintenance operations performed, until being optimally recycled. INFINITE intends to deliver improvements in composite manufacturing and structural health monitoring (SHM) by the development of functional sensorised Non-Crimp fabrics (NCF). These fabrics will provide an efficient real-time monitoring system through a self-sensing fibre by wireless monitoring of the fibre position, orientation, strain-stress and temperature. This will be achieved by applying a safe magnetic signal, providing a volumetric information during the manufacture process (temperature and fibre control) but also during the life of the component. In service, the new SHM system will provide information about component integrity, performance and safety; therefore informing and improving maintenance operations. The new sensorised NCF will also enable a new repair capability for complex parts. Integration of microwires in the fabric opens new possibilities in the design of future functional composites using existing sensoring technologies. This advanced quality monitoring has the potential to deliver a significant impact on cost and safety reliability of composite components, providing a competitive advantage of European manufactures and MROs. INFINITE also aims to assess the effect of sensoring hardware on the current methods for composite recycling, investigating the potential for re-using (other applications, sectors, etc.) both sensors and components  to provide useful end of life functionality.

Advancing The Clinical Development Of Placental Malaria Vaccines In The Context Of Capacity Building and Use Of Digital Health Technologies	"Placental malaria (PM) is a severe disease that affects a particularly vulnerable demographic group, pregnant women. The burden of disease is high, threatening more than 100 million women every year and causing the death of an estimated 50,000 pregnant women and up to 200,000 infants. An effective vaccine would be an attractive tool to control PM on its own, or to complement the existing yet imperfect tools. 
ADVANCE-VAC4PM will build on the success of previously conducted first-in-human (phase I) clinical studies in Europe and Africa, assessing the two PM vaccine candidates PAMVAC and PRIMVAC. The clinical trial results demonstrated that both adjuvanted vaccine candidates are safe and well-tolerated and induce good homologous immune responses demonstrating the feasibility of developing a PM vaccine. However, prior to embarking on costly, large scale phase II clinical trials, it is essential to optimize the cross-reactivity of the vaccines. Overall project objective is to advance the PM vaccine development and to broaden the immune response by i) increasing the vaccine-induced antibody level by using Virus-Like particles (VLP) to display the PM antigens or ii) by evaluating if a co-administration approach using PRIMVAC and PAMVAC-cVLP will increase cross-reactivity and cross-inhibitory antibody titers. 
These activities will be embedded in capacity building activities e.g. workshops, training of MSc/PhD students, small competitive research grants to African early career researchers and development of immunology laboratory capacity. 
In preparation of future PM vaccine trials, digital tools will be evaluated. Pregnancy registers will be developed and the feasibility and acceptability of using mobile applications for tracking pregnancy outcomes will be assessed. Modelling the cost-effectiveness, feasibility and acceptability of PM vaccines will further strengthen the case. Awareness on the need for a PM vaccine will be raised in stakeholder engagement activities."

Advanced POwer conversion technologies based on onboard ammonia cracking through novel membrane reactors	"Through a holistic approach, APOLO aims to tackle the challenges of power conversion from ammonia and develop an efficient and flexible ammonia cracking technology. This technology will be coupled with fuel cells and engines to achieve complete decarbonization of the maritime sector.
As the main objective of the call is to demonstrate scalability beyond 3MW, the consortium will focus on showcasing the following demonstration units: 
i) A 125kW power conversion system that utilizes an ammonia cracker coupled with a PEM fuel cell system, achieving an overall system efficiency of 51% to 54%. The ammonia cracker will be customized to work with different pressure conditions and efficiency levels of PEM fuel cells. A comparison of efficiency levels will be conducted to evaluate the flexibility of the cracking system for all types of PEM fuel cells.
ii) A 125kW partial ammonia cracker coupled with a 4-stroke engine, exhibiting an overall system efficiency above 45%
APOLO is dedicated to minimizing the ecological footprint of transportation and energy, focusing on the maritime sector. To achieve this, we're actively developing innovative power conversion technologies such as cracker, fuel cell, and engine, and utilizing life cycle assessment (LCA) at various stages of product development.
The technologies developed in APOLO are capable of targeting the first 30,000 ships in the market. Initially, the focus will be on vessels with 1 to 10 MW propulsion, with a significant number of them being around 3 MW in the next decade, as these are the first vessels relevant for ammonia-powered solutions."

Advanced Intelligent stimulation device: HAND movement restoration	"Very advanced stimulation paradigms applied to peripheral nervous system (PNS) have been studied for years even decades among
which the 3D current distribution through multi-contact epineural electrodes. Non rectangular stimulus waveforms are also of strong
interest to provide more efficient or fibre type selective stimulation. However none were implemented in an Active Implanted Medical
Device and thus almost none validated through clinical trials. One of the reasons is the high complexity of the needed analogue front
end and its safe control by a microcontroller or a digital system. AI-HAND project aims at developing a breakthrough, ASIC based
technology, together with a specific self adapting epineural multi contact electrode to provide such an AIMD. The demonstration of
the clinical relevance of such an approach will be achieved through a first-in-man proof of concept aiming at the restoration of hand
movements in persons with complete quadriplegia. It means that a full innovative device should be developed and validated in
animals, but the real added value will be supported by the clinical trial; indeed, no animal model exists while the clinical needs is
clearly stated by clinicians and patients. Thus this project will innovate concerning both the technology and the therapeutic approach
with a minimally invasive concept. Indeed, spatial selectivity allows to stimulate nerves selectively targeting muscles through 3D
currents shaping instead of implanting one electrode per muscle. The technology clearly addresses generic issues so that the paradigms and the innovative technology can be further used to stimulate the central nervous system (spinal cord and brain) and, on a long term basis, may drastically open new therapeutics for medical needs that are still unmet."

HYBRIDplus aims to pioneer the next generation of CSP with an advanced innovative high-density and high-temperature thermal energy storage (TES) system capable of providing a high degree of dispatchability at low cost and with much lower environmental burden than the State of the Art. This thermal storage is based in the Phase Change Material (PCM) technology in a cascade configuration that can reproduce the effect of a thermocline and integrates recycled metal wool in its nucleus that provide hybridization possibilities by acting as an electric heater transforming non-dispatchable renewable electricity such as PV into thermal stored energy ready to be dispatched when needed.  HYBRIDplus proposes a novel approach to concentrated solar power with a PV+Cascade PCM-TES CSP configuration based on a high temperature supercritical CO2 cycle working at 600 ºC. This new plant is called to form the backbone of the coming energy system thanks to a higher efficiency and lower LCoE than state-of-the-art technology, and in addition to other benefits such as full dispatchability reached with the hybridization in the storage that allow higher shares of variable output renewables in the energy system and environmental friendliness (lower CO2 emissions, minimum water consumption, enhancement life cycle impact).

Adaptive virtualization for AI-enabled Cloud-edge Continuum	"As of today, 80% of the data processing and analysis occurs in cloud data centers, and only 20% of processing occurs at the edge. This incipient exploitation of edge resources increases time to value and prevents business processes, decisions, and intelligence to be taken outside of the data center, which prevents Europe to unlock an entire set of new opportunities to serve different industries and use cases in Europe in the next years. To help to materialize the European bid on a true continuum in the next few years, CloudSkin pursues to build a cognitive cloud continuum platform with three main innovations: 

1. The CloudSkin platform will leverage AI/ML to optimize workloads, resources, energy, and network traffic for a rapid adaptation to changes in application behavior and data variability, re-configuraing the ""sweet spot"" between the cloud and the edge in the face of the rapid varying conditions;
2. The CloudSkin platform will also help users to achieve “stack identicality” across the Cloud-edge continuum, whereby the same (legacy) software stacks (e.g., MPI programs) running in data centers can seamlessly run at remote edges. The development of a new lightweight, portable virtualizaion abstraction will be paired with the development of new confidential abstractions to protect data while it is in use; and 
3. CloudSkin will also contribute to prepare the needed infrastructure to integrate the new virtualized execution abstractions into the virtual resource continuum, particularly, for those Cloud-edge applications composed of small tasks with fast data access and sharing requirements. The infrastructure will expose the relevant control knobs to enable dynamic reconfiguration of resources as assisted by the AI/ML-based orchestration plane in the CloudSkin platform.

Altogether,  the above innovations are the strategic elements of what we envision as the new “cognitive continuum for the cloud and edge""."

Actionable policies for adopting high-quality integrated long-term care	"Long-term Long-term care (LTC) services are intended for people who depend on help with daily living activities and who may also need permanent nursing care. Disability increases as we get older, but  can be found in all age groups. 
The LAUREL project aims at gathering valuable insights into regional differences of integrated long-term care (I-LTC) provision and their support solutions in Europe. Using this intelligence, it will develop actionable policies to respond to the challenges of growing demand, economic constraints, accessibility, affordability, quality of services, shortages of members of the workforce, and systemic reforms.
LAUREL will identify a set of the best innovative, integrated care solutions leading to better quality, person-centred LTC and overcoming territorial and gender inequalities in their provision.  The project has the following six sub-objectives:
1) Develop a set of methods and tools for mapping and characterising I-LTC services in the EU27, covering: availability and accessibility, affordability, reliability, quality, workforce, funding, governance, autonomy and empowerment, and supporting technologies; and transversally incorporating the gender perspective and regional differences (rural/urban gap).
2) Undertake a field study in EU-27 to identify the most successful innovative practices.
3) Analyse the features of identified I-LTC services and context-dependent factors that provide insights into policies for the adoption/development of the best innovative practices, including supporting technologies.
4) Use this analysis to carry out qualitative research in the EU27 to generate a consensus on actionable policies favouring a shift to I-LTC, by investigating the change management strategies that favour policy adoption
5) Produce a white paper on I-LTC that gathers together all the findings of the project and the consensually agreed actionable policies.
6) Develop a set of training courses and tools to maximise the impact of the results."

Accelerated Cell- and Battery Testing	"Today’s battery development is impeded by a lack of virtualization, resulting in cost-and time-intensive physical verification and validation (V&V) activities. AccCellBaT addresses these shortcomings by substantially advancing virtualization, front-loading, and continuous V&V in future technology battery development to optimize battery design, cost, and time-to-market.
Focusing on beyond state-of-the-art cell chemistry, novel physics-based and data-driven simulation models are developed to determine performance, lifetime, reliability, and safety of battery sub-systems. To ensure model applicability and high confidence, these models are accompanied by novel in-live model parameter measurement techniques, and by upscaling methods to scale cell models up to battery system models. Models and measurement data are synthesized to digital twins to be utilized in V&V.
To advance front-loading, tests of these digital twins are merged with physical tests in a novel hybrid design verification and validation plan (hybrid DVP) methodology. To objectively quantify and ensure the confidence of test results, a tailored confi-dence index methodology for approval of the hybrid DVP is introduced. Based on Systems Engineering principles, processes and methods currently used by AccCellBaT consortium members are combined with the hybrid DVP and optimized to create a process-and-method manual applicable for future battery development. These building blocks of the full AccCellBaT methodology are implemented in a development tool, which provides an inte-grated development environment for management, planning and execution of battery V&V. The tool supports practitioners in development and significantly increases the level of process automation.To ensure validity and applicability of the AccCellBaT methodology across industries, the methodology is validated by two original equipment manufacturers (representing via automotive and stationary application a crucial share on battery system market)."

ATomicallY Precise nanorIbbons QUAntum pLatform	ATYPIQUAL’s main objective is to unveil a room temperature quantum technology platform based on a novel generation of Atomically Precise graphene nanoRibbons (APRs) and demonstrate its feasibility through technologically relevant devices. By definition, quantum technologies exploit the peculiar quantum properties of matter such as superposition, tunneling, and entanglement to develop tools and devices with new, non-classical functionalities. However, derived using conventional top-down techniques, these technologies lack atomic precision and are much more sensitive to environmental disturbances as compared to the electrical current switching in transistors. As such, they often require ultra-low temperature operation and impose important constraints on their general applicability. This makes their manipulation and integration to chip-scale substrates a major challenge. ATYPIQUAL is a highly interdisciplinary project that proposes a radically different high-risk bottom-up approach that uniquely offers to naturally 'hard-wire' complex quantum states into atomically precise carbon nanostructures: APRs. They exhibit novel physical properties beyond graphene such as topological quantum phases and spin polarization, all tailorable by their topology and edge structure. However, the demonstration of these electronic properties requires atomic precision control that can only be achieved through recent advances in bottom-up synthesis. We shall exploit atomically precise bottom-up on-surface synthesis to develop these novel advanced APRs offering on-demand multi-functionalities while relying on a single graphene nanoribbon backbone. By developing the required material processing and device fabrication steps and demonstrating the first technologically relevant feasibility examples, ATYPIQUAL will set the stage for a new quantum technology platform for atomically tunable multifunctional devices with applications in next-generation electronics, photonics and spintronics.

ASSESS-DHT: DEVELOPMENT AND HARMONISATION OF METHODOLOGIES FOR ASSESSING DIGITAL HEALTH TECHNOLOGIES IN EUROPE	ASSESS-DHT will increase the adoption of trustworthy and effective Digital Health Technologies (DHT) across Europe, enabling a more coherent digital single market, for health systems and patients to access DHT from all over Europe and giving industry a European market. We will develop a new assessment framework, beyond the existing models, capable of uniform HTA adoption across Europe, addressing new assessment challenges in Digital Therapeutics, AI and telehealth. Our consortium comprises 4 HTA bodies, the European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies, 5 academic and not for profit organisations with expertise in EU Regulation, DHT development and assessment methodologies, data protection, data quality, interoperability and cybersecurity. Patients and health professionals are included through the International Diabetes Federation and European Society of Cardiology. We include the DHT industry through companies with products for us to assess through a formal methodology mimicking actual HTA assessments – 3 as partners, some through an open call and industry-wide consultation via DIGITAL EUROPE. We will engage healthcare payers and ministries through our Advisory Board. We will co-create our overarching assessment framework with specialised pathways for different categories of DHT specified through a novel evidence-based typology. We will cater for phased adoption (going beyond fast track models like DiGA), complex life-cycles, iteratively developed AI, consolidated in a comprehensive HTA assessment manual plus specific guides in topics like cybersecurity. We will develop a sustainable repository containing the ASSESS-DHT framework, pathways and unambiguous criteria, a semantically searchable evidence library, checklists and tools to support companies with evidence generation, evidence of health system value from DHT, and online communities of practice.	digital health technology assessment	EMPIRICA GESELLSCHAFT FUR KOMMUNIKATIONS UND TECHNOLOGIEFORSCHUNG MBH - EMPIRICA	BETTER CARE SL -; FEDERATION INTERNATIONALE DU DIABETE REGION EUROPE AISBL - IDF EUROPE	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101137347/program/43108390/details	
AI-based CCAM: Trustworthy, Explainable, and Accountable	"Connected and Cooperative Automotive Mobility (CCAM) solutions have emerged thanks to novel Artificial Intelligence (AI) which can be trained with huge amounts of data to produce driving functions with better-than-human performance under certain conditions. The race on AI keeps on building HW/SW frameworks to manage and process even larger real and synthetic datasets to train increasingly accurate AI models.
However, AI remains largely unexplored with respect to explainability (interpretability of model functioning), privacy preservation (exposure of sensitive data), ethics (bias and wanted/unwanted behaviour), and accountability (responsibilities of AI outputs). These features will establish the basis of trustworthy AI, as a novel paradigm to fully understand and trust AI in operation, while using it at its full capabilities for the benefit of society.
AITHENA will contribute to build Explainable AI (XAI) in CCAM development and testing frameworks, researching three main AI pillars: data (real/synthetic data management), models (data fusion, hybrid AI approaches), and testing (physical/virtual XiL set-ups with scalable MLOps).
A human-centric methodology will be created to derive trustworthy AI dimensions from user identified group needs in CCAM applications. AITHENA will innovate proposing a set of Key Performance Indicators (KPI) on XAI, and an analysis to explore trade-offs between these dimensions.
Demonstrators will show the AITHENA methodology in four critical use cases: perception (what does the AI perceive, and why), situational awareness (what is the AI understanding about the current driving environment, including the driver state), decision (why a certain decision is taken), and traffic management (how transport-level applications interoperate with AI-enabled systems operating at vehicle-level).
Created data and tools will be made available via European data sharing initiatives (OpenData and OpenTools) to foster research on trustworthy AI for CCAM."

AI powereD characterization and modelling for GREEn STeel technology	"The fourth industrial revolution and market demands for advanced steels are driving the research towards transformation of the manufacturing processes and to ever-more sustainable steel compositions. The conventional ‘trial and error’ approach traditionally used to develop metallurgical processes still prevails in the industrial steel plants. However, it is a time-consuming, labour-intensive process entailing high material waste and associated carbon emissions. Also, it can ultimately lead down to a repetitive path that consists of creating a process design, putting it into production, and detecting possible process design flaws too late, resulting in high component rejection rates. Ascertaining the inadvertent flaws in the manufacturing approach before its implementation on industrial lines could be the key to major cost savings. With the introduction of AI- and simulation-driven design, back-and-forth interaction between part and process designs can be significantly diminished.
The main objective of AID4GREENEST is to develop six new AI - based rapid characterization methods and modelling tools. AID4GREENEST tools’ scope will cover the steel design (chemistry and microstructure), process design (processing parameters), product design (processing and heat treatments) and product performance (creep) stages. Proposed tools will be complemented with a roadmap designed to enable model-based innovation processes, from materials design to product development, while considering the industry needs: enhanced material quality, reduction of carbon emission and waste generation, and reduced supply risk of critical raw materials. In order to facilitate the knowledge transfer of the characterization and modelling data generated in this project and across the wider European characterization and modelling community, the project will also develop an open online platform, based on a standardized and interoperable data management system and following the EMMC, EMCC and EMMO approach."

A multiplexed biomimetic imaging platform for assessing single cell plasticity (Plastomics) and scoring of tumour malignancy	Metastasis is the major cause of death in cancer patients due to cancer cell dissemination to distant organs. Cell plasticity is a core characteristic of metastatic cells and confers cellular adaptation capabilities to variable mechano-chemical tissue microenvironments. However, to date, specific quantitative measures of cancer cell plasticity associated with tumour aggressiveness and therapy resistance have remained difficult to establish. A major limitation is the availability of highthroughput multiplexed assays that can capture phenotypic heterogeneity and morphodynamic plasticity at the single cell level in standardized 3D culture conditions reflecting in vivo tissue microenvironments. The PLAST_CELL interdisciplinary consortium will pioneer the development of a microfluidics-based imaging platform to categorize and score cancer cell plasticity within diverse physiologically relevant 3D biomimetic culture conditions. The platform will enable to perform single cell multi-scale morphometric and molecular live cell data collection (PLAST_DATA) with minimal sample size (<10k cells). Data will be generated based on single molecule-sensitivity marker detection and cellular/subcellular morphodynamic feature recognition via minimal-invasive long-term super-resolution microscopy and parallel morphodynamic imaging of cellular behaviour. Computational integration of PLAST_DATA using preclinical models and patient samples will enable to develop a quantitative classification of tumour cell plasticity and predictive scoring of cancer aggressiveness, metastasis and drug resistance (PLAST_SCORE). The ability to assess cell plasticity based on cellular behaviours is beyond current clinical parameters and will strongly impact diagnosis, prognosis and treatments. The PLAST_CELL platform will be a technology breakthrough to establish new quantitative standards to evaluate cell plasticity and mechanisms of tumour malignancy for a new era of basic research and personalized medicine.	cell plasticity; cancer stem cells; tumor heterogeneity; cellular morphodynamics; cytoskeleton, biomimetic cultures; microfluidics; single molecule imaging; structured illumination microscopy	FUNDACIO CENTRE DE REGULACIO GENOMICA - CRG-CERCA	CHERRY BIOTECH - CHERRY BIOTECH; EUROPEAN MOLECULAR BIOLOGY LABORATORY - EMBL	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101046620/program/43108390/details	
A metapredictive model of synthetic awareness for enabling tool invention	"Around 3.3 million years ago our ancestors made the first tool. They imagined a new utensil and then knapped a stone until it became an efficient tool for cutting. Tool creation was an outstanding technological milestone for humanity providing us with unprecedented control over our environment. This ability required cognitive capabilities, such as prediction, metacognition, abstraction, and creativity—all of which are associated in humans with awareness. Current artificial intelligence systems and robots largely lack these capabilities and cannot even monitor and evaluate the consequence of their actions let alone develop new tools to address environmental challenges.

METATOOL aims to provide a computational model of synthetic awareness to enhance adaptation and achieve tool invention. This will enable a robot to monitor and self-evaluate its performance, ground and reuse this information for adapting to new circumstances, and finally unlock the possibility of creating new tools.
Under the predictive account of awareness, and based on both neuroscientific and archeological evidence, we will: 1) develop a novel computational model of metacognition based on predictive processing (metaprediction) and 2) validate its utility in real robots in two use case scenarios: conditional sequential tasks and tool creation.

METATOOL will provide a blueprint for the next generation of artificial systems and robots that can perform adaptive, and anticipative, control with and without tools (improved technology), self-evaluation (novel explainable AI), and invent new tools (disruptive innovation). Tool-making and tool-invention are outstanding technological milestones in human history. A similar breakthrough can now be envisioned in engineering. We already have algorithms to enable machines to use tools and now it is time to develop robots that create tools."

A holistic approach in patient management and epidemic surveillance through convergence of diagnostic technologies, capacity building and stakeholder engagement	Research on Poverty-Related Diseases (PRDs) in sub-Saharan Africa suffers from major technological and non-technological challenges that prevent high quality healthcare to reach many areas. Not only their performance, but also the affordability, manufacturability, suitability for Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs) and deployment of the (few) available diagnostics are main barriers to ensure good quality of healthcare in sub-Saharan Africa. The HoliCare project aims to tackle such challenges from a holistic perspective, by bridging the gap between technological excellence, available infrastructures, capacity, and local uptake of new technologies. We have chosen to work with lower respiratory infections as a blueprint for our new approach due to their huge clinical and socioeconomic impact, and relevance to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Technology-wise, we propose a 2-tiered, digitally interfaced diagnostic approach that will start in the field using multiplexed lateral flow tests for rapid screening and triage, followed by a referral to a hospital (when needed) and a follow-up detailed diagnosis using a POC-Instrument performing simultaneous nucleic acid amplification (LAMP) for pathogen identification and immunoassays for host biomarker quantitation. Digital and manufacturing infrastructures will encompass these technology innovations to ensure future local product development. Quality controlled biobanks will be developed for executing reliable clinical studies. Training and human capital investment will be achieved by focussed and high-level training activities. Adoption and implementation activities will pave the way for the proposed diagnostic solutions to be successfully deployed, fitting the purpose of the local populations. Our developments will be scalable, adaptable and transferrable to other diseases and national (eco) systems, aiming to contribute to the improvement of healthcare delivery in sub-Saharan Africa.

A dynamic, ultra-stable, random-access RNA retrieval database	In order for DNA to become the information storage medium that serves as an alternative to existing digital storage solution technologies information must be stored stably in it with the means to repeatedly access and manipulate parts of the stored data. Only few in vitro approaches are capable to address some of these requirements, while in vivo approaches still produce largely static data storage libraries, which limits the real-life applicability of these technologies. In this proposal we present a new, regeneratable solid state storage system consisting of beads, where information, encoded in single stranded DNA strands, can be added, selectively accessed and removed using enzymes and nucleic acid strands as inputs for the different data operations in isothermal reactions with no loss of material. To achieve this a strand architecture is proposed, where unique Data ID sequences are used on the targeted data strands for performing the intended data operations via enzymatic reactions: addition, deletion of data and transcription-based data access. Furthermore, a variant of this system is proposed that uses RNA molecules for the selective access of the data strands, which we aim to implement in a bacterial data storage system as well where RNA encoding bacteriophages will be used as a non-invasive way to introduce inputs for the data operations, such as random data access and removal.   Finally, we present the use of damage suppressor proteins from extremotolerant organisms complementing the in vitro and in vivo system to provide the long-term stability of DNA observed in resilient biological systems.

A distributed data-mining software platform for extreme data across the compute continuum	Data has become one of the most valuable assets, driving the digital transformation across many sectors. Current data mining solutions are optimized to deal with specific data requirements, but fail to cope as the data characteristics become extreme. There is therefore an urgent need for novel and holistic approaches to enable the development, deployment and efficient execution of data mining workflows across a heterogeneous, secure and energy-efficient compute continuum, while fulfilling the diverse extreme data characteristics. To fill this technological gap, EXTRACT will deliver a data-driven open-source software platform integrating the most relevant technologies, to facilitate the development of trustworthy, accurate, fair and green data mining workflows able to generate high-quality actionable knowledge. The EXTRACT platform will improve the complete lifecycle of extreme data mining workflows, significantly enhancing performance, energy-efficiency, scalability and security, while fulfilling the extreme data characteristics in a holistic way. Moreover, multiple computing technologies, from edge to cloud to HPC, will be integrated into a unified and secure compute continuum. Specifically, the platform will feature enhanced data infrastructures and AI & big-data frameworks, novel data-driven orchestration and distributed monitoring mechanisms, a unified continuum abstraction and cybersecurity and digital privacy across all software layers. The EXTRACT platform will be validated in two real-world use-cases with different extreme data requirements: 1) a Personalized Evacuation Route service, integrating data from the European data sources, Copernicus and Galileo, with 5G localization signals and smart city IoT sensors for civilian-centric crisis management; and 2) Transient Astrophysics with a SKA pathfinder, processing extreme data from 2000 radio-telescopes for the real-time assessment of solar activity, generating knowledge for further scientific exploitation.	extreme data; interoperable compute continuum; data infrastructure; ; AI & big-data workflows; data-driven orchestration; edge-to-cloud-to-HPC; European data sources; cybersecurity; energy-efficiency	BARCELONA SUPERCOMPUTING CENTER CENTRO NACIONAL DE SUPERCOMPUTACION - BSC CNS	BINARE OY -; CITTA' METROPOLITANA DI VENEZIA -	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101093110/program/43108390/details	
A clinical research network to improve the management of Monkeypox virus disease	The 2022 Monkeypox outbreak is unprecedented in scale and cases are still active in South America and starting to appear in South-East Asia. Many questions about Monkeypox virus disease remain unanswered to this day, particularly concerning the management of patients. MPX-RESPONSE aims to increase our knowledge of the monkeypox virus disease, to improve its therapeutic management and to further inform public health policies and guidelines through four Work Packages (WP). WP2 (MOSAIC) will assess clinical and virological outcomes of Monkeypox patients treated or not with antiviral drugs, focusing treatment on the most severe cases. WPs 3 and 4 will conduct randomized clinical trials (RCT) with the most promising antiviral therapy, tecovirimat, targeting patients in Europe (WP3-EPOXI) and globally in collaboration with WHO (WP4-UNITY); particularly in mild and moderate cases. A common primary outcome will be shared between the two RCTs and EPOXI will include additional objectives regarding pharmacological, immunological and virological outcomes in six to ten EU/EEA countries and fulfill in particular EMA requirements for treatment authorisation. A continuous systematic review and individual patient meta-analysis will summarize all randomized evidence of the interventions for monkeypox. Finally, the project will make sure that acquired knowledge is integrated into public health policies and guidelines and that adequate messages are shared with the general public and high-risk populations with the help of patients’ representatives and associations (WP1-COORDINATE). To accomplish these objectives, MPX-RESPONSE will build on the expertise and networks of multiples partners including Ecraid and EU-RESPONSE and will reinforce and broaden Europe’s capacity to respond rapidly to public health emergencies.

A Space Warehouse Concept and Ecosystem to Energize European OSAM	"Implementing sustainable commercial activities in Earth orbit requires not only the key technologies necessary to offer the targeted services (OOS / ISAM) but also the means to effectively ensure the (re)supply of the associated facilities. Storage and handling of goods and resources in orbit, in support of OOS or ISAM, have received limited attention in the perspectives and roadmaps of the major future space ecosystem and economy players.

STARFAB aims to explore a novel concept of an automated orbital Warehouse Unit (WU) within the context of both OOS and ISAM (also known as OSAM) commercial perspectives. It seeks to address a critical gap in the future space ecosystem, serving as an enabler for sustainable OSAM business models.

The STARFAB project will develop a Phase A equivalent concept and demonstrator of an orbital Warehouse Unit (WU), drawing inspiration from the state-of-the-art automated warehousing practices on Earth, while considering the challenging environmental conditions encountered in space, such as microgravity, vacuum, extreme temperatures, and radiation. STARFAB's objective is to advance the necessary technologies for handling goods in space (including modular and custom-shaped components, raw materials for manufacturing, fuel, water, and more), using robotics and automation. This will encompass storage elements with varying levels of protection, the Items Handling Solution (IHS), featuring custom automation tools for operations within the warehouse structure, and the Item Transfer System (ITS), designed as a robotic manipulator to provide flexible external item transfer within the WU. The STARFAB concept will also include provisions for robotic inspection and minor maintenance tasks, primarily for STARFAB's own integrity but possibly also as a service for spacecraft docking or berthing with STARFAB.

At the end, STARFAB will produce a roadmap outlining the path forward for technology maturation, model philosophy, market opportunities, and subsequent exploitation measures"	Warehouse automation; storage; space robotics; OOS; OSAM; circular economy; space ecosystem; space economy	SPACE APPLICATIONS SERVICES NV - SPACEAPPS	FRAUNHOFER GESELLSCHAFT ZUR FORDERUNG DER ANGEWANDTEN FORSCHUNG EV - Fraunhofer; SOCIETE NATIONALE DE CONSTRUCTION AEROSPATIALE SONACA SA - SONACA SA	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101135507/program/43108390/details	
A Paradigm Shift in Health Monitoring with Electrospun Enzymatic Neomaterials	Global healthcare associated with chronic non-healing wounds can be considered a main public health problem as affects up to 2% of the world population. A novel approach is needed mainly to support the quality of life of the people suffering from this silent epidemic and additionally, alleviate the impact in costs and resources for the healthcare system. Up to date, no smart bandages have made it to the real market and research state is still going on for a reliable and sensitive inspection method.  The main goal of WOUNDSENS project is to lead the development of a novel generation of wearable biosensors with a synergy of technological breakthroughs in transversal fields of knowledge. Sensor elements, for the first time, will directly become a compatible part of the wound dressing material itself resulting in enhanced wearing comfort and operability. Accordingly, they will be integratable into manufacturers' existing standard processes (suturing, embroidery, roll-to-roll). Our proposal presents a parading shift in smart wound dressings constructed on novel hollow fibers with radial bio-signaling based on engineered novel enzymes.  WOUNDSENS presents a leading-edge new technology with the design and development of innovative electrochemical materials with step forward advances in CONDUCTIVE MATERIAL, the development of electrospun neofibers and processes with leading edge methodologies on ELECTROSPINNING and the ENZYME ENGINEERING of a new family of detection biocatalysts (resurrected and extant enzymes) to secure a sensitive and reliable signal. WOUNDSENS proposal accepts the challenge of pushing forward the new technological platform to design a new concept in continuous wound control and monitoring improving the life of millions of people.

A EUROPEAN MULTI-DISCIPLINARY CLINICAL PROJECT MEANT TO IMPROVE THE MANAGEMENT OF PATIENTS WITH POOR PROGNOSTIC OVARIAN CANCER AFTER NEOADJUVANT CHEMOTHERAPY: RESTORING HOPE, SALVAGING LIVES	"The standard medical-and-surgical treatment of ovarian carcinoma patients relies on a systemic chemotherapy (carboplatin-paclitaxel), a tumor debulking surgery meant to be complete (no post-operative residual lesion), and a subsequent maintenance treatment with modern targeted agents. Recent studies identified a patient population (~14,000 patients / year in Europe), whose prognostic is poor (5 year-overall survival (OS) <20%) due to a refractory cancer, characterized by a poor chemosensitivity (assessable online with the numeric CA-125 KELIMTM score <1.0), and by a disease found non-resectable disease after 3-4 cycles of chemotherapy. In these patients, there is a high uncertainty about the best treatment adjustments to apply. 
SALVOVAR is a European project led by HCL, meant 1) to raise the physician awareness, and propose practical and affordable diagnostic tools for identifying these patients, and 2) to assess the utility (OS benefit), acceptability (quality-of-life; patient perception) and affordability (cost-effectiveness, including country coverage policies) of solutions based on adjustments of their medical-and-surgical treatment. These solutions implementable in routine may improve their prognosis, according to recent literature data. The project will be based on a large pragmatic randomized phase III trial, sponsored by ARCAGY-GINECO group, and activated in 6 countries (ENGOT network; ~100 recruiting centers), with the objective of demonstrating an OS benefit with the chemotherapy densification (weekly carboplatine-paclitaxel dose-dense regimen) compared to the continuation of the standard 3-weekly regimen. Total 685 patients treated with the standard neo-adjuvant chemotherapy will be pre-screened to randomize 240 patients. Dissemination, and communication will be carried-on to ensure the quality of the project, and inform the stakeholders, patients, public, health authorities/ payers of the project outcomes, mean to change the practices.

5G+ evoluTion to mutioRbitAl multibaNd neTwORks	5G mobile networks will be soon fully available, handling all types of applications and providing services to massive number of users. In this complex and dynamic network ecosystem, an optimized end-to-end satellite support is key to manage requirements imposed by multiple vertical industries requiring full global connectivity. The European space sector acknowledged this as a key opportunity to expand its business towards the massive deployment of broadband services, what resulted in standardization efforts to adapt 5G to satellite needs. In this context, the aim of TRANTOR is to perform a significant step forward by paving the path for the 5G NTN evolution towards 6G. To do so, TRANTOR targets the in-orbit validation of a complete satellite value chain involving an automated management of satellite resources across multiple bands, satellites, and orbits, and a converged radio access network. Specifically, at the ground segment, TRANTOR targets the development of novel satellite network management solutions, fully integrated in the 3GPP management framework, which allow the significant scaling up of heterogeneous satellite traffic demands and capacities in a cost-effective, highly dynamic, band and orbit agnostic manner. AI governance will be a main pillar here enabling real time radio resource management across multiple satellite systems for efficiently and trustworthy addressing satellite client needs. In parallel, in the user segment, TRANTOR aims to radically increase the flexibility of access architecture by enabling pre-6G non-terrestrial multi-connectivity. It will be supported by the design of a multi-orbit and multi-band antenna for satellite UEs as well as by the development of gNB and UE 5G NTN equipment able to attend the multi-connectivity needs. Finally, TRANTOR aims to introduce security mechanisms to provide resilience to all types of cyber-threads, specially those emerging from the integrated management and multi-connectivity framework proposed.	satellite communications; ground segment; multiorbit; multiband; multitrp	CENTRE TECNOLOGIC DE TELECOMUNICACIONS DE CATALUNYA - CTTC	CONSIGLIO NAZIONALE DELLE RICERCHE - CNR; FRAUNHOFER GESELLSCHAFT ZUR FORDERUNG DER ANGEWANDTEN FORSCHUNG EV - Fraunhofer	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101081983/program/43108390/details	
4-Deep Brain Reconstruction	The 4-Deep Brain Reconstruction, 4-DBR consortium aims at generating a brand-new technological approach to regenerate brain affections that occurs in neurological disorders. With 180 million affected people and an economic burden of 798 billion euros/year, Europe needs a radical leap in the future. The complexity of the human brain has condemned every past attempt at regeneration because incomplete technologies did not allow for a full recapitulation of the brain properties and any one of them missing jeopardized the functionality of the whole. There can't be any incremental solution for brain damage, the technology must be all-in. 4-DBR will focus on developing an implantable 4D reconstructed brain able to recapitulate all brain properties: a complex architecture of neuronal cells integrated in a complete blood circuitry, that will be complemented with an integrated opto-stimulator to induce correct specification and integration of neurons. 4-DBR integrates 6 technological leaders from complementary fields who will unite to develop the components of reconstructed-brains: laser-assisted bioprinting of pre-differentiated neurons with their native decellularized brain matrix, extrusion bioprinting of vascular system, in vitro blood-brain-barrier reconstruction and a tissue integrated wireless-controlled stimulating optoelectrical chip. These 4 components will then be combined into a transplantable reconstructed brain that will be tested in a small animal model of Huntington’s disease. While a first prototype will be delivered in 36 months, the vision unifying 4-DBR expands way further. Therefore, the project will put into action a strong dissemination and exploitation plan: horizontally, 4-DBR will ensure the uptake of the generated methods to strengthen Europe’s technological actors; vertically, 4-DBR will thrust the reconstructed brain approach up in the development ladder to potentially generate in a 10-year span a therapy to change the lives of many patients. 	3D bioprinting; organoid transplantation; optoelectrical chip engineering	FUNDACIO DE RECERCA CLINIC BARCELONA-INSTITUT D INVESTIGACIONS BIOMEDIQUES AUGUST PI I SUNYER - IDIBAPS-CERCA	DANMARKS TEKNISKE UNIVERSITET - TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY OF DENMARK DTU; OSPEDALE SAN RAFFAELE SRL - OSR	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101047099/program/43108390/details
