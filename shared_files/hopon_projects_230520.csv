Novel, orally available immune modulator MP1032 with anti-SARS-CoV-2 and anti-cytokine activity (iMPact)	The current global COVID-19 pandemic has caused severe health and socio-economic challenges. Despite significant improvements in the treatment of critical COVID-19 patients and advances in vaccine development, there is still an urgent need for safe and effective early-intervention treatments. To reduce disease burden, hospitalization time, and mortality, it is of critical importance to halt disease progression in early (mild-to-moderate) stages. Our new drug, MP1032, has a dual mode of action, targeting two important mechanisms (immune system overactivation and viral replication) in the early development of COVID-19. Its unique mechanism of self-regulation prevents immune-suppression, which is critical for early intervention. In combination with the oral availability, favourable safety profile, rapid and affordable production scale-up, and potential to work against viral variants, MP1032 is the ideal candidate for early treatment of COVID-19, which can also be used safely in high-risk patients. Therefore, the iMPact project aims to clinically validate MP1032 in a Phase II trial for its ability to stop COVID-19 disease progression. The outcome of the project shall serve as a basis for follow-up rapid Phase IIb/III development and market registration. Four international SME’s will work together in the iMPact project to achieve the objectives: 1) To demonstrate the efficacy of MP-1032 in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, 2) To demonstrate the effect of MP1032 on current SARS-CoV-2 variants, 3) To develop a GMP-compliant production scale-up process for MP1032, 4) To ensure that the clinical development plan is in line with regulatory requirements and 5) To collaborate with existing EU research networks. We have 29 clinical sites on board, and the required expertise for upscaling GMP manufacturing and regulatory preparation is available, ensuring that, by October 2022, MP1032 will be ready to progress to Phase IIb/III trials.

ExeVir's XVR011, a best in class nanobody-based biology that broadly neutralizes SARS-COV-1 and SARS-COV-2 (XVR011 Phase 2)	XVR011, ExeVir's clinical lead candidate has emerged from scientific research from labs of highly regarded virologist Xavier Saelens and biochemist Nico Callewaert. Nonclinical data has recently been published in Cell and a preprint on BiorxIV. XVR011 is a nanobody-Fc fusion, has best-in-class potential, neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 and minimizes the development of lung damage in hamsters. The lama-derived single-domain antibodies are smaller than human antibodies and can attach to parts of a virus that are difficult to access for the human immune system. XVR011 inactivates spike proteins and sterically blocks spike binding to ACE2, preventing virus from entering a human cell, stopping viral replication; this supplements the patient's own immune response in a critical time window during which many COVID-19 patient's immune system reacts too slowly, giving it more time to do its job and eliminate the virus. It binds to a unique highly conserved epitope in the viral receptor-binding domain. Its epitope is much less susceptible to human antibody immunity pressure that can lead to viral escape, resulting in retained potency against such escape variants. It thus neutralises the rapidly spreading SARS-CoV-2 variants, and exhibits a unique, wide scope binding across the Sarbecovirus clades. Furthermore, XVR011 has been optimized for stability, safety and manufacturability. XVR011 received approval from the Belgium regulators to move into its Phase 1b. Seven IP patents were filed early on during the pandemic. ExeVir has surrounded itself with both a team of experienced entrepreneurs and is backed by a mix of private and public experienced partners and has a strong board of directors bringing with expertise across the whole value chain. The objectives of this proposal is to demonstrate XVR011 safety and efficacy in a global Phase 2; to strengthen its nonclinical package including neutralising variants data, set-up its manufacturing process and progress its regulatory pathway.

EU-Africa Concerted Action on SAR-CoV-2 Virus Variant and Immunological Surveillance (CoVICIS)	Despite of the successful advances achieved to date in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic with the development of vaccines and therapy, the worldwide propagation of SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in the rapid evolution of this virus and in the emergence of variants of concern (VOC) that may dampen the efficacy of the first generation vaccines. To tackle the challenges associated with the VOC, the CoVICIS program is proposing a global approach with a powerful state-of-the-art virologic and immunologic platforms coupled with large genomic surveillance studies and diverse cohorts in EU and SSA. This allows CoVICIS to contribute to the early identification of emerging VOC and address key unanswered questions regarding i) the susceptibility to infection with VOC after a prior infection in the setting of a long-COVID or after vaccination with different vaccines, ii) the risk posed by VOC in immunocompromised patients, and iii) the modalities of infection and immune responses in children. The diversity of the cohorts provides a unique opportunity to study virus evolution in different settings, where SARS-CoV-2-specific humoral and cellular immune responses are predicted to vary very significantly. Beyond the genomic surveillance, the ground-breaking research and innovation of the program is the characterization of virologic and immunologic properties of VOC and the identification of immune correlates of protection after disease or vaccination. CoVICIS’ ambitious goals are only achievable thanks to the existing population studies and cohorts funded by national and international public agencies and public-private partnerships, and the combined collective expertise of CoVICIS partners in the fields of epidemiology, genomics, virology, immunology, data science and public health.

Biointegrable soft actuators alimented by metabolic energy (INTEGRATE)	State-of-the art implantable actuating devices, such as automated prosthetics, have time-limited operational capacities because they are sustained by batteries which, ultimately, rely on external power sources to be recharged. INTEGRATE proposes a radically new way to solve this problem: use metabolic energy from the patient to power implanted devices. To achieve this ambitious goal, INTEGRATE will develop i) new 3D printable soft actuating materials inspired by human muscles whit high performances and low power consumption and ii) an artificial organ capable of harvesting metabolic (biochemical) energy and transform it into electricity. The actuating materials (Bionic Muscles) will be prepared via self-assembly of biocompatible colloidal liquid crystals and stimuli-responsive polymers. A modular design and 3D printability will offer the possibility to manufacture these materials on the basis of patient’s anatomy and needs. The Energy-Harvesting Organ will be capable of converting pH differences within various body fluids (e.g. gastric juice and saliva) in electricity with high efficiency, providing the necessary power to sustain the Bionic Muscles. This research will revolutionize the field of implantable devices and will represent a turning point in robotics, wearable technologies, materials science, energy conversion, and materials engineering.	artificial muscles, bionics, energy-autonomous prosthetics	VELTHA IVZW	TECHNISCHE UNIVERSITEIT EINDHOVEN, UNIVERSITA DEGLI STUDI DI ROMA TOR VERGATA, CENTRE NATIONAL DE LA RECHERCHE SCIENTIFIQUE CNRS	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101046333/program/43108390/details	
Complex chemical reaction networks for breakthrough scalable reservoir computing (CORENET)	The brain is the world’s most amazing computer and it runs entirely on chemical reactions. The vision of CORENET is to construct brain-mimicking computing devices that utilise networks of chemical reactions as molecular information processing systems. To achieve this vision, we will implement reservoir computing (RC) on microfluidic chips using chemical reaction networks (CRNs) that convert input feedstock molecules and environmental conditions into a pattern of product molecules. This pattern can be monitored on a chip using a combination of high-throughput mass spectrometry analysis, algorithmic cheminformatics and AI tools. CORENET will generate a breakthrough in highly scalable and functional chemical RC by integrating our partners’ new knowledge and state-of-the-art methodologies in systems and analytical chemistry, microfluidics, cheminformatics and machine learning. CORENET will produce microfluidic chip devices that perform high-level computing with molecules, synthesising and analysing a pattern of output molecules in situ. This molecule-based computing power enables truly sustainable AI and speaks the language of living systems, which constantly process information about their molecular environment. Future applications of our chemical RC system lie in implantable devices, brain-machine interfaces and personalised medicine. CORENET brings together 4 leading scientists with complimentary expertise that covers all fundamental aspects of this project. Their expertise is combined with the world-class knowledge in AI/ML modelling of a high-tech global industry partner with unique research and computing infrastructure, while an SME specialised in the communication and dissemination of results will ensure maximised impact. Our highly interdisciplinary team will generate new scientific knowledge and breakthrough technologies to achieve essential priorities for Europe`s future and its support to the UN Sustainable Development Goals.

Hybrid electronic-photonic architectures for brain-inspired computing (HYBRAIN)	As artificial intelligence (AI) proliferates, hardware systems that can perform inference at ultralow latency, high precision and low power are crucial and urgently required to deal – especially quasi-locally, i.e. ‘in the edge’ – with massive and heterogenous data, respond in real time and avoid unintended consequences and function in complex and often unpredictable environments. Conventional digital electronics and the associated computer architecture is unable to meet these stringent requirements with sub-ms latency inference and a sub-10W power budget, using convolution neural networks (CNNs) on benchmarks such as ImageNet classification. HYBRAIN’s vision is to realize a pathway for a radical new technology with ultrafast (~1 microsecond) and energy-efficient (~1 watt) edge AI inference based on a world-first, brain-inspired hybrid architecture of integrated photonics and unconventional electronics. The deeply entwined memory and processing like in the mammalian brain obviates the need to shuttle around synaptic weights. The most stringent latency bottleneck in CNNs is in the initial convolution layers. Our approach will take advantage of the ultrahigh throughput and low latency of photonic convolutional processors (PCPs) employing novel phase-change materials in these initial layers to radically speed up processing. Their output is processed using cascaded electronic linear and nonlinear classifier layers, based on memristive (phase-change memory) crossbar arrays and dopant network processing units, respectively. HYBRAIN’s science-towards-technology breakthrough brings together the world’s top research groups from academia and industry in complementary technology platforms. Each of these platforms is already highly promising, but by integrating them, HYBRAIN will have a transformative effect of overcoming existing barriers of latency and energy consumption and will enable a whole new spectrum of edge AI applications throughout society.

an electric Contrast medium for computationally intensive Electroencephalographies for high REsolution BRain imaging withOut skull trepanation (CEREBRO)	Imaging the brain activity is fundamentally important for many brain-related scientific disciplines. Among the non-invasive neuroimaging strategies, Electroencephalography (EEG) from scalp potentials is one of the primary. In EEG the neuroninduced electric potential is measured by using electrodes on the patient’s scalp. The skull however, highly resistive, shields EEG recordings limiting the spatial resolution. The standard way to avoid skull shielding effects is to invasively implant EEG electrodes under the skull (ECoG) or in the brain cortex (StereoEEG), in both cases after trepanning the patient’s skull. Scalp EEGs are noninvasive but lack spatial imaging accuracy. ECoG and StereoEEG are highly accurate but require skull trepanation and they image only a limited part of the brain. There is the need for increasing the resolution of scalp EEG providing the same level of accuracy of invasive EEGs. This will be the grand challenge which CEREBRO will achieve by conceiving the first ever existing EEG contrast medium, able to provide imaging of the entire brain and in a non-invasive way.

Chip-scale Optical Atomic Clock (CSOC)	Optical atomic clocks are at the heart of modern technology. From time-keeping to navigation to global positioning systems. This project will develop the world’s first all optical atomic clock that is chip scale. It will create this based on recent advances in Kerr soliton micro-comb technology, ps mode locked lasers that are heterogeneously integrated on a chip, and using novel on chip frequency doublers with vastly improved efficiency. Exploiting the Rb85 two photon transition enables to obtain a clock signal that is vastly improved compared to today’s radio frequency transition based clocks. This clock can revolutionize timekeeping in both mobile, airborne or space application and used in future GPS networks such as Galileo. Moreover the underlying clockwork - a chipscale comb - can have applications ranging from distance measurements, to time and frequency metrology. This consortium brings together the leading groups in Europe in the domain of Frequency combs, micro-comb technology and photonic chipscale laser integration.	atomic clock, frequency comb, photonic chip	UNIVERSITEIT GENT	MENLO SYSTEMS GMBH, DANMARKS TEKNISKE UNIVERSITET	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101047289/program/43108390/details	
Bottom-up reconstruction of a Synthetic Erythrocyte (SynEry)	Blood is a precious and vital resource for many clinical interventions. Erythrocytes, its key component, are used to save thousands of lives every day worldwide. Yet, in low- and middle-income countries, its scarcity and unsafe control are endemic burdens that cost lives. In spite of several decades of attempts to develop a safe and universal blood substitute, this goal has yet to be achieved. Beyond the mere transport of gasses, erythrocytes have evolved together with their host organisms to perform very specialized functions. It is now clear that much of their complexity is indispensable to establish effective cardiovascular regulation. Yet, reproducing this complexity in a synthetic, functional facsimile is a challenging endeavour that requires new methods and multidisciplinary approaches. The ambitious goal of SynEry is to reproduce, in an advanced lipid vesicle, the following key features of erythrocytes: adequate lipid asymmetry with raft-like nanodomains; integration of essential functional proteins (both cytosolic and transmembrane) and a biomimetic cytoskeleton (conferring durability, flexibility and biconcavity); enhanced immune tolerability; responsivity to environmental cues (such as under deformation and hypoxia). These goals will be tackled by an interdisciplinary consortium bringing expertise on: droplet-based microfluidics combined with interfacial self-assembly of biofunctionalized nanoparticles (to build complex biomimetic membranes with ordered cytoskeletal nanodomains); DNA origami and self-assembling peptide technologies (to reconstruct a biomimetic cell cortex); and in-vivo testing models (to verify biocompatibility and functionality). The knowledge gained by producing a synthetic erythrocyte, is envisioned to enable the production of artificial cells with in-vivo applicability and it will pave the way towards the future development of an effective blood substitute that can remedy pervasive global blood availability and safety issues	artificial cells, synthetic erythrocytes,	KATHOLIEKE UNIVERSITEIT LEUVEN	FONDAZIONE CASA SOLLIEVO DELLA SOFFERENZA, AGENCIA ESTATAL CONSEJO SUPERIOR DE INVESTIGACIONES CIENTIFICAS, INSTITUT NATIONAL DE LA SANTE ET DE LA RECHERCHE MEDICALE	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101046894/program/43108390/details	
Quantum Control of Gravity with Levitated Mechanics (QuCoM)	The main objective of QuCoM is to demonstrate the proof of concept (TRL 1) of a levitated acceleration sensor and its ability detecting gravity of small masses and in the quantum controlled regime. Toward this objective we will explore the interplay between quantum mechanics and gravity in a parameter range accessible for cost-effective table-top experiments. We will suspend sub millimetre particles in optical and magnetic traps and use those to detect gravitational forces in an unprecedented mass regime. Also, we will investigate quantum superpositions in which these masses are delocalized. We will address some of the most popular theoretical proposals combining quantum physics and gravity in a nonstandard fashion. The proposed experiments will assess their limits of validity and/or further constrain the values of their parameters. The consortium consists of two experimentalists, two theorists, and two SMEs to address the objective. The experiments in question will be performed with optically and magnetically trapped micro/nano-particles based on the experimental expertise of partners in the consortium. Levitated mechanics experiments at Southampton have been already picked up by the EU Innovation radar. In QuCoM we will, go beyond and demonstrate the two-mass gravity sensing as well as the operation of our sensors in the quantum domain. The state preparation, control and analysis schemes are based on the expertise of the theory partners. QuCoM partner high-tech SMEs will help to optimize the experimental apparatus for fulfilment of the targeted objectives, which will in turn put them in a position to offer their improved products in sub mK, low vibration cryogenic equipment to market. The SME LSI will explore, together with University of Leiden, the feasibility of implementing our technology into a micro-satellite platform for space-based metrology and Earth Exploration utilizing gravitational detection. This is our direct technology impact and innovation case.

ulTRafast hOlograPHic FTIR microscopY (TROPHY)	Many human pathologies such as cancer are due to complex biochemical alterations that start at a sub-cellular level and lead to progressive changes that result in a heterogeneous tumor composition. The polyclonality of tumor cells hampers the diagnosis and the therapy giving rise to tumor clones that lead to therapy resistance and promote metastases. An accurate diagnosis of tumor biopsies to identify these particular cell clones is crucial to provide targeted therapy tailored to the tumor characteristics, to improve the patient outcomes and increase survival rates. For this vision to come true, we introduce ulTRafast hOlograPHic FT-IR microscopY (TROPHY) as a paradigm shift in vibrational microscopy, blending elements of photo-thermal infrared (PT-IR), Fourier transform (FT)-IR, and Digital Holography Microscopy (DHM). TROPHY brings these techniques to the unprecedented ultrafast timescale, where the refractive index change induced by coherent IR vibrations is probed at its peak value before thermal relaxation. TROPHY borrows from PT-IR the combination of IR vibrational excitation with visible probing for high spatial resolution, from FT-IR the use of time-domain interferometry to obtain a high spectral resolution from broadband excitation, from DHM highly sensitive and quantitative detection of the refractive index (phase) change. Combined with artificial intelligence algorithms, this technology will enable quantitative concentration imaging of molecular biomarkers with high spatial resolution, high chemical selectivity and high speed, with a transformative impact on medical research and clinics. In oncology, it will be applied to intraoperative diagnosis of tumor biopsies, providing tumor grading, staging and subtyping, and supporting complete tumor resection. It will also allow to determine the best therapeutic approach tailored to the patient and identify resistant tumor clones under targeted therapy, paving the way for precision medicine in cancer.

Phase-sensitive Alteration of Light colorAtioN in quadri-parTIte gaRnet cavIty (PALANTIRI)	The elder wand of telecom wizards would coherently change the color of light. But while the laws of physics do allow mutating the photon chroma, all attempts to date have been very inefficient for large frequency mismatches. PALANTIRI will initiate a technological breakthrough by providing a viable development path for integrating the coherent and efficient interconversion of information between microwaves and light on a chip. We propose a radically new approach building on quadripartite (microwave photon-magnon-phonon-optical photon) hybridization process. The idea is to exploit opto-mechanical effects while inserting a magnetic element that maintains high cooperativity both with a mechanical mode through magneto-acoustic coupling and with the microwave antenna through inductive coupling, while exploiting magnetic texture to achieve perfect matching of the microwave precession profile with the optical mode. This opportunity has recently emerged from progress in material science, which allows the fabrication of freestanding micron-size slabs of ultra-high quality magnetic insulator yttrium iron garnet. The suspension greatly suppresses any leakage of phononic or photonic oscillating energy through the substrate. PALANTIRI’s scientific objectives are to deliver within 42 months a proof of principle on-chip analog coherent frequency converter with efficiency of the order of unity (TRL2). The delivered phase-sensitive device will provide the breakthroughs needed to achieve a radical expansion of the connectivity capacity of a backhaul network for enabling high-speed internet access for everyone from any location. It will also provide the elementary brick to build the quantum-ready internet infrastructure of the future. To achieve these goals, our consortium consists of six academic partners (CEA, MLU, CNRS, TUD, ICN2, MPG) from four EU countries (FR, DE, NL, ES) and one industrial partner (TSST).

Breaking the penetration limit of microscopy – Photoswitching Optoacoustics (SWOPT)	SWOPT is a novel imaging technology that will break through the penetration limits of optical microscopy to visualize individual cells and their function in vivo through several millimeters to centimeters of depth. SWOPT will exploit (1) optoacoustic imaging (OAI), a modality which combines signal generation similar to optical imaging with the whole-animal imaging capability of ultrasound readout, and uniquely augment it with (2) photoswitching to resolve signals from single labeled cells from deep within live tissue. This will achieve volume sampling abilities surpassing any optical microscopy by at least three orders of magnitude (> 5 x 5 x 5 mm imaging volume). SWOPT will develop the necessary breakthrough instrumentation and concepts: unique multiplexed diode illumination, novel ultra-wideband transducer technology, dedicated inversion algorithms that incorporate photoswitching in the three-dimensional reconstructions, and uniquely tailored classes of photo-switching transgene and synthetic molecular tools. The exceptional capabilities of SWOPT will be demonstrated by proof-of-concept work resolving cellular dynamics and functions in a whole tumor in a model of renal cancer in vivo. SWOPT builds on the world-leading expertise in the disciplines of OA imaging technology (Ntziachristos GER), applied mathematics (Unser CH), and cancer metabolism (Frezza UK) and is driven by excellent young researchers in protein-engineering (Stiel GER) and chemical synthesis (Szymanski NL) and supported by the science-to-technology focus of ambitious high-tech SMEs (Sonaxis FRA, iThera GER). SWOPT’s uniquely comprehensive, yet detailed imaging will enable examination of whole tissues in vivo with the same ease, flexibility and, eventually, abundance of tools paralleling fluorescence microscopy, thus bringing research and understanding of living organisms to the next level. As an affordable imaging technology, SWOPT aspires to become routine in life science and bio-medical research.

ECL-based Infectious Pathogen (bio)SEnsor (ECLIPSE)	"Infectious diseases are a threat to mankind since their appearance in human history. Despite the advances in science and technologies, such threats are still recurrent, as recently shown by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 – 2021, which has revealed the urgent need for novel tools for pathogen detection that would be at the same time reliable, fast, cheap, portable and simple. The goal of ECLIPSE is to address this need, with a new platform exploiting innovative ultrasensitive protocols for the detection of pathogens. ECLIPSE builds on the combination of interdisciplinary elements to facilitate the transfer to industry, i.e., (i) ElectroChemiLuminescence (ECL) as a very sensitive transduction mechanism for realizing simple, portable and cheap devices, (ii) bio-, nano-, and supramolecular-based signal amplification structures for increasing the sensitivity, and (iii) two recognition strategies to afford high affinity and selectivity, thus leading to high reliability: the Phage-Sandwich technology for the whole pathogen, and the Surface Cooperative Hybridization technology for microbial and viral nucleic acid. We will demonstrate the feasibility and adaptability of the ECLIPSE platform with three test cases: a virus (SARS-CoV-2), a bacterium (Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and a protozoan parasite (Leishmania infantum). The platform is designed to be applied to many other infectious agents, making it a ""ready for the next pandemic” technology. ECLIPSE is expected to become a game-changer in European countries, where it could be a cornerstone for fast testing and reliable tracking of infections, and in developing countries that will benefit from a cheap and simple approach to detect the many infectious diseases that affect millions of people every year. The project results will be validated and demonstrated at partners’ premisses."

Energy Storage in Molecules (ESiM)	ESiM wESiM will create the scientific basis for a radically new technology addressing the pressing challenges of scalable clean energy storage. The ESiM strategy is to use the conformational degrees of freedom of organic molecules, and to create dense molecular arrays of scalable dimensions on a surface to avoid the limits of battery technology based on ions flow and on environmentally harmful substances. ESiM will provide the proof of principle that storing energy in molecules is feasible, constructing laboratory devices and validating the scientific and technological basis for novel energy storage devices. ESiM will produce scientific and technological achievements well beyond the fields of the individual partners, involving chemistry, physics, and simulation tools. The added value of our interdisciplinary approach will enable the development of methods and materials for an efficient storage of energy in specific degrees of freedom of organic molecules on a supporting surface, ultimately leading to an environmentally friendly, recyclable way of producing, storing, and using energy. Molecules will be designed and synthesized to first capture a possible deviation from the micro-reversibility principle and demonstrate energy pumping and storing in a few specific intramolecular mechanical degrees of freedom. Then, 2D molecular layers will be developed to efficiently store this energy using electric fields and inelastic electrons as a second energy source. As a proof of principle, ESiM will produce a device based on a bimetallic cantilever to store and release energy from the active molecules. ESiM will maintain close contact with industry via regular meetings (ESiM-Industry days) involving nanotechnology startups, energy providers and high-tech SMEs, to favour exchange and synergy towards the identification of innovative potential technology transfer. ESiM will use public talks, scientific workshops, and scientific publications to reach the broadest possible audience.	scanning tunneling microscopy, surface science, single molecule actuator (rotor, switch), molecular synthesis, energy storage	TECHNISCHE UNIVERSITAET DRESDEN	CENTRE NATIONAL DE LA RECHERCHE SCIENTIFIQUE CNRS, AGENCIA ESTATAL CONSEJO SUPERIOR DE INVESTIGACIONES CIENTIFICAS, LEIBNIZ-INSTITUT FUR POLYMERFORSCHUNG DRESDEN EV, RIJKSUNIVERSITEIT GRONINGEN	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101046364/program/43108390/details	
Intracellular Carrier Against Resistant microOrganisms (ICARO) (ICARO)	Intracellular pathogens and viruses elicit immune responses by presenting their antigens to T cells. At the same time, they have evolved immune evasion mechanisms which essentially reduce the antigenic repertoire that is presented to the immune system. To overcome this problem, the EIC-funded ICARO project proposes to use silicon-based microchips that carry pathogen antigens and can be internalised by immune cells to aid antigen presentation. These biochips are retained within cells for a long time and will provide the foundation for a novel vaccination strategy that can boost specific and long-lasting T cell responses.

A multiplexed biomimetic imaging platform for assessing single cell plasticity (Plastomics) and scoring of tumour malignancy (PLAST_CELL)	Metastasis is the major cause of death in cancer patients due to cancer cell dissemination to distant organs. Cell plasticity is a core characteristic of metastatic cells and confers cellular adaptation capabilities to variable mechano-chemical tissue microenvironments. However, to date, specific quantitative measures of cancer cell plasticity associated with tumour aggressiveness and therapy resistance have remained difficult to establish. A major limitation is the availability of highthroughput multiplexed assays that can capture phenotypic heterogeneity and morphodynamic plasticity at the single cell level in standardized 3D culture conditions reflecting in vivo tissue microenvironments. The PLAST_CELL interdisciplinary consortium will pioneer the development of a microfluidics-based imaging platform to categorize and score cancer cell plasticity within diverse physiologically relevant 3D biomimetic culture conditions. The platform will enable to perform single cell multi-scale morphometric and molecular live cell data collection (PLAST_DATA) with minimal sample size (<10k cells). Data will be generated based on single molecule-sensitivity marker detection and cellular/subcellular morphodynamic feature recognition via minimal-invasive long-term super-resolution microscopy and parallel morphodynamic imaging of cellular behaviour. Computational integration of PLAST_DATA using preclinical models and patient samples will enable to develop a quantitative classification of tumour cell plasticity and predictive scoring of cancer aggressiveness, metastasis and drug resistance (PLAST_SCORE). The ability to assess cell plasticity based on cellular behaviours is beyond current clinical parameters and will strongly impact diagnosis, prognosis and treatments. The PLAST_CELL platform will be a technology breakthrough to establish new quantitative standards to evaluate cell plasticity and mechanisms of tumour malignancy for a new era of basic research and personalized medicine.	cell plasticity, cancer stem cells, tumor heterogeneity, cellular morphodynamics, cytoskeleton, biomimetic cultures, microfluidics, single molecule imaging, structured illumination microscopy	FUNDACIO CENTRE DE REGULACIO GENOMICA	FUNDACIO INSTITUT HOSPITAL DEL MAR D INVESTIGACIONS MEDIQUES, FUNDACIO INSTITUT DE CIENCIES FOTONIQUES, EUROPEAN MOLECULAR BIOLOGY LABORATORY, CHERRY BIOTECH	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101046620/program/43108390/details	
Smart 4D biodegradable metallic shape-shifting implants for dynamic tissue restoration (BIOMET4D)	Reconstructive surgeries frequently require multiple, often complex, procedures at high social and economic costs. A shape-morphing implant that can be implanted using less invasive procedures and that then undergoes predesigned shape changes, leading to tissue expansion and allowing for complete degradation coupled with tissue regeneration, is a radically new treatment concept. BIOMET4D aims to create a new generation of shape-shifting and load-bearing implants for dynamic tissue restoration and to introduce a revolutionary paradigm in how actuators can be implemented in biomedicine. Science-towards-technology breakthroughs will be demonstrated with new shape-morphing metamaterials, 4D smart metallic actuators, advanced multi-domain optimization tools, and finally proof-of-concept for two potential clinical applications. Technologically, this vision also goes beyond existing paradigms because of the step-by-step actuation mechanisms, enabled through the additive manufacturing of multi-material degradable metallic structures, that are targeted for an order of magnitude improvement compared to the state-of-the-art. A futuristic long-term vision of this breakthrough technology is to dynamically regenerate entire tissues, such as a nose or an ear, and proof-of-concept will be demonstrated for craniosynostosis treatment and skin expansion. This long-term vision can only be achieved through an interdisciplinary approach and will likely have high social and economic impact as well as provide a new line of research for applications of smart metamaterials in medicine and engineering.

Providing operational economic appraisal methods and practices for informed decision-making in climate and environmental policies (PATTERN)	The PATTERN project’s general objective is to improve practitioners’ capacity for decision making on climate and environmental policies, by developing an interactive online platform for the economic appraisal of policies and measures. To reach this general objective, the project will develop an operational integrated economic appraisal approach (WP3 and 4), deliver guidelines to bridge ex-post and ex-ante analyses (WP1), build and demonstrate an effective participatory process to create 5 Theories of Change (WP2), build a European Community of Practice for climate and environmental policymaking (WP6), and create a One-Stop-Shop for all policy and decision makers to access and use the project results easily. PATTERN will thus provide decision-makers, stakeholders, and the public with more realistic and operational ability to systematically assess their policies and their consequences. It will provide a basis for improving (i) methodologies, techniques and models for conducting economic appraisal of climate and environmental policies (ii) the broader policy evaluation framework and practices currently used in European countries and their regions and (iii) tailored analysis and engagement strategies structures for the participation and co-creation with relevant stakeholders and key actors to enhance operational capacities and improve the impact of European policies on climate and environment. Overall, results obtained from in-depth ex-post and ex-ante analysis of the PATTERN’s 5 case studies will bring new evidence on the effectiveness of various types of regulatory strategies, instruments and approaches for climate and environmental policies and insights for the design and evaluation of the implementation of major European policies.	climate change, biodiversity, policy-making, decision-making, operational tools, methods, models, social sciences and humanities	UNIVERSIDAD COMPLUTENSE DE MADRID	VLAAMSE INSTELLING VOOR TECHNOLOGISCH ONDERZOEK N.V., UNIVERSITA DEGLI STUDI DI TORINO, UNIVERSITEIT ANTWERPEN, NORGES TEKNISK-NATURVITENSKAPELIGE UNIVERSITET NTNU, LAPPEENRANNAN-LAHDEN TEKNILLINEN YLIOPISTO LUT, MINISTERIE VAN ECONOMISCHE ZAKEN EN KLIMAAT, TRONDELAG FYLKESKOMMUNE, VLAAMSE LANDMAATSCHAPPIJ, LAPPEENRANNAN KAUPUNKI, EUROQUALITY SAS, ISMERI EUROPA	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101056734/program/43108390/details	
Novel Opaque Scintillator Technology for Nuclear Industry Imaging based on Anti-Matter Detection (AntiMatter-OTech)	We propose to deliver a novel technology for the nuclear industry to open the possibility of direct monitoring of nuclear reactions inside nuclear power plant cores. The new technology centres on a radically-new and totally counter-intuitive approach to radiation detection that has arisen from neutrino physics research. As of today, direct and rapid in-situ measurement of nuclear reactor fission activity is not possible. Our technology is expected to make this possible by using the copious neutrinos that stream out of nuclear reactors. Achieving this leap relies on the paradigm shifting nature of our approach. Detection of radiation makes extensive use of light emitting materials known as scintillators. These are nearly always transparent, to allow the light to be seen and measured. Our radically-new approach is to use an opaque scintillator, coupled with a lattice of optical fibres to extract the light. This technique naturally provides high-resolution imaging of anti-matter annihilation plus many other types of radiation (e.g. betas, gammas, neutrons), improving the signal to noise ratio of anti-neutrino detection by a factor >10x. Consequently, our technology would be able to tolerate the high background environment close to a reactor. The civil nuclear industry will benefit in a range of ways from safety and societal reassurance to operational efficiencies with a direct economic return. Our technology will also be able to provide remote monitoring and information on any nuclear processes that emit neutrinos, opening many potential new markets. Examples include spent nuclear fuel containers, fuel pools and waste disposal sites as well as nuclear warheads and fusion reactors such as ITER. Our inter-disciplinary consortium pulls together experts from mechanical and electronics engineering, nuclear and particle physics, chemistry and computing with our major industrial partner in the civil nuclear energy industry to make this radical new technology a reality.

Response of the Earth System to overshoot, Climate neUtrality and negative Emissions (RESCUE)	The RESCUE project will improve knowledge and understanding in area c) of this call: “Climate and Earth System responses to climate neutrality and net negative emissions”, by pursuing two overall objectives: 1) Quantify the climate and Earth system responses to pathways achieving climate neutrality by Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) deployment with and without temperature overshoot, and 2) Assess the potential role of CDR in reducing net GHG emissions, as well as its potential environmental risks and co-benefits. RESCUE will expand existing knowledge on CDR methods, to design a suite of new global temperature stabilization scenarios at several target values to achieve the first objective. New model developments will deliver improved climate projections with explicit representation of CDR portfolios for these scenarios. The analyses will be devoted to finding suitable pathways to climate neutrality considering multiple aspects of the Earth system response: mean climate and extremes, sea-level rise, global carbon cycling, biodiversity, and ecosystem services. Particular attention will be paid to the reversibility of induced changes by comparing scenarios with and without temperature overshoot. The second objective will be achieved by analyses assessing various factors determining overall effectiveness, impacts and co-benefits of CDR portfolios. These factors include CDR-specific CO2 uptake, CDR-induced biogeophysical climate feedbacks, CDR-derived non-CO2 radiative forcers, and the interaction between socio-economic and environmental impacts (e.g., biodiversity). Moreover, a dedicated analysis will provide key criteria for developing a monitoring system for the effectiveness of CDR portfolio deployments and their potential side effects. Stakeholders will be closely engaged throughout the project to ensure policy relevance and final update of the results which will be made freely available via existing climate services.

Better Contrails Mitigation (BeCoM)	Aviation contributes to about 5% of the total anthropogenic climate change when including non-CO2 effects, e.g., contrail formation and the impact of NOx emissions on ozone and methane. Among various non-CO2 effects, the contrail-cirrus radiative forcing is the largest (~2/3) with large uncertainties. The most critical affecting factor is the huge weather-induced variability of the radiative impact of individual contrails. This is the quantity, BeCoM will predict better since the knowledge of the individual radiative forcing is the basis for avoidance of just those contrails that contribute most to the overall climate impact. Once this is standard, it will be possible to formulate adequate mitigation measures and develop policy-driven implementation schemes. BeCoM will address the uncertainties related to the forecasting of persistent contrails and their weather-dependent individual radiative effects. BeCoM focuses on: 1) obtaining a larger and higher resolution database of relative humidity and ice supersaturation at cruise levels for assimilation into numerical weather prediction (NWP) models; 2) providing more adequate representation of ice clouds in their supersaturated environment in the NWP models; and 3) validation of the predictions to determine and reduce the remaining uncertainties of contrail forecasts. To facilitate the assimilation and validation process, BeCoM will develop a novel hybrid artificial intelligence algorithm. Based on the contrail prediction, BeCoM will develop a policy framework for effective contrail avoidance through a trajectory optimization approach. BeCoM will enable a better understanding of contrail’s climate impact and formulate recommendations on how to implement strategies to enable air traffic management to reduce aviation's climate impact. The BeCoM consortium builds on its knowledge and expertise covering a wide spectrum from atmospheric science and climate research to aviation operations research and policy development.	non-CO2 climate impact; operational measurements; ice cloud physics; hybrid-AI assisted assimilation and contrail detection; trajectory optimization; policy-driven flight planning	TECHNISCHE UNIVERSITEIT DELFT	DEUTSCHER WETTERDIENST, DEUTSCHES ZENTRUM FUR LUFT, THALES, CENTRE NATIONAL DE LA RECHERCHE SCIENTIFIQUE CNRS, ENVISA SAS, ECATS INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION AISBL	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101056885/program/43108390/details	
GREENHOUSE GAS FLUXES AND EARTH SYSTEM FEEDBACKS (GreenFeedBack)	The Ambition of GreenFeedBack is to enhance knowledge of the GHG dynamics in the ecosystems and link GHG in terrestrial, freshwater and marine ecosystems to provide a solid basis for estimation of regional and global climate feedback processes taking human pressure on ecosystems into account. GreenFeedBack will study the processes in sensitive terrestrial, freshwater, coastal and marine areas of which some are hypothesized to be tipping elements in the climate system. Thus, we will primarily focus on high latitude terrestrial and freshwater systems, marine shelves and ocean areas and thereby advance the process-based representation of ecosystems in Earth System Models (ESM). The analysis will involve co-design between scientists and stakeholders. We will use data from the ICOS and ACTRIS stations in Europe and the GIOS, GEM and SMEAR network in Greenland and Finland as well as data from dedicated field and laboratory studies. The enhanced knowledge will be used to improve descriptions of the GHG processes for implementation in ecosystem models and ESMs. Hence, GreenFeedBack will improve and apply ecosystem- and Earth System models to advance our understanding of GHGs effect on climate variability over different time horizons.	carbon cycle, air-sea exchange	AARHUS UNIVERSITET	UPPSALA UNIVERSITET, KOBENHAVNS UNIVERSITET, HELSINGIN YLIOPISTO, LUNDS UNIVERSITET, UNIVERSITE DE LIEGE, OULUN YLIOPISTO, VLAAMS INSTITUUT VOOR DE ZEE, LUONNONVARAKESKUS, CENTRE NATIONAL DE LA RECHERCHE SCIENTIFIQUE CNRS, UNIVERSITETET I TROMSOE, MAX-PLANCK-GESELLSCHAFT ZUR FORDERUNG DER WISSENSCHAFTEN EV, GRONLANDS NATURINSTITUT	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101056921/program/43108390/details	
Aerospace Composites digitally sensorised from manufacturing to end-of-life (INFINITE)	INFINITE aims to develop sensors and analyser based on the usage of ferromagnetic microwires to be embedded in aerospace composite structural parts, in order to monitor manufacturing and structural health throughout the whole life cycle of the component. The wireless monitoring system will permit producing digital signals and vast sets of data linked with the specimen to create an as-built digital twin of the structure that will also account for the whole history since it was manufactured through all maintenance operations performed, until being optimally recycled. INFINITE intends to deliver improvements in composite manufacturing and structural health monitoring (SHM) by the development of functional sensorised Non-Crimp fabrics (NCF). These fabrics will provide an efficient real-time monitoring system through a self-sensing fibre by wireless monitoring of the fibre position, orientation, strain-stress and temperature. This will be achieved by applying a safe magnetic signal, providing a volumetric information during the manufacture process (temperature and fibre control) but also during the life of the component. In service, the new SHM system will provide information about component integrity, performance and safety; therefore informing and improving maintenance operations. The new sensorised NCF will also enable a new repair capability for complex parts. Integration of microwires in the fabric opens new possibilities in the design of future functional composites using existing sensoring technologies. This advanced quality monitoring has the potential to deliver a significant impact on cost and safety reliability of composite components, providing a competitive advantage of European manufactures and MROs. INFINITE also aims to assess the effect of sensoring hardware on the current methods for composite recycling, investigating the potential for re-using (other applications, sectors, etc.) both sensors and components to provide useful end of life functionality.

Full spectrum SOLar Direct Air Capture & conversion (SolDAC)	Ethylene is the chemical industry’s primary building block. SolDAC’s ambition is to reinvent the ethylene industry by proving (TRL4) an emerging breakthrough technology for producing technically and economically competitive, socially desirable and climate-neutral (sustainable) ethylene and co-product ethanol (C2 products) from solar energy and air. The project features a photo-electrochemical conversion (PEC) unit, being electrochemistry the only possible route for direct conversion of carbon dioxide into ethylene. The PEC exploits bandwidth-selected light from a solar collector (FSS) that splits the solar spectrum for electricity and heat generation at efficiency higher than standalone PV modules and standalone solar thermal collectors. Heat is used in an innovative direct air capture (DAC) unit at ultralow temperature (~60°C), fostering the eventual circular integration with heat networks. The DAC unit removes carbon dioxide from the air, concentrates it to 95+% and compresses it to feed the PEC stack and a pipeline for carbon dioxide storage. This allows the carbon footprint of the whole sun-to-chemicals process to be offset and enables gain in carbon credits, opening an opportunity to exceed climate-neutrality and produce carbon-negative C2 products. The process is energetically self-sufficient, economically viable and carbon-negative on the condition that each unit (DAC, PEC, FSS) reach new targets in efficiency. That is exactly the high-risk/high return outcome expected in the project. The research is balanced to overcome technical, early-stage social and market barriers by exploiting the expertise of its 8 partners (SMEs in the renewable technology field, leading EU research institutions and one networking NGO). This project performs all the necessary groundwork for the full deployment of the process before 2050 through activities that build up a new ecosystem of stakeholders, making Europe the first circular, climate-neutral and sustainable economy.	zero-carbon, solar energy, air mining, Negative Emission Technologies (NET), Direct Air Capture (DAC), photo-electrochemical conversion (PEC), full spectrum solar collector (FSS)	COMET GLOBAL INNOVATION, SL	LOMARTOV SL, FUNDACIO INSTITUT DE RECERCA DE L'ENERGIA DE CATALUNYA, CONSIGLIO NAZIONALE DELLE RICERCHE, UNIVERSIDAD DE LLEIDA, EUROPEAN INNOVATION MARKETPLACE ASBL	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101069359/program/43108390/details	
Carbon Neutral Milk (CANMILK)	The challenge of agricultural GHG emissions is that they are highly diluted and originate from more than 10 million European farms. Thus, local emissions are small but the combined contribution on European level is ca. 10% of total GHG emissions. A significant portion of these is methane (ca 43 %), and most of that is produced by enteric fermentation, i.e. by belching cattle. Viable technical solutions do not exist for methane abatement, and new developments are urgently needed to meet the targets set by Methane Strategy, Farm to Fork Strategy and Fit for 55 legislation package for agricultural carbon neutrality in 2035. They must have high potential for commercialization, be efficient in methane abatement and costs must be affordable for the farmers. CANMILK will develop technology that is simple to use and has low maintenance, with overall cost below 80 €/t CO2-eq. A non-thermal plasma, or cold plasma, is today in everyday use e.g. in fluorescent lamps and ozone generators. CANMILK project will utilize this technology in a novel and innovative way in the fight against methane. The work is focused on the methane activation by plasma derived oxygen or hydrogen species enabling methane decomposition with the help of catalysts at mild conditions. As a result we expect to get 1) a simple and efficient equipment for methane abatement in dairy and meat cattle barns, 2) a good view of the socio-economic and environmental feasibility of plasma-based methane abatement and 3) increased public, scientific and industrial awareness of feasible solutions available for GHG abatement in agriculture. Our estimate for the efficiency of the CANMILK technology is 90% methane conversion, which in case of maximum utilization in barns would lead to total GHG abatement of ca. 140 Mt CO2-eq/a in Europe. This would have significant positive impacts to farmers, rural communities, consumers and industry in the transition of the European economy towards more carbon neutral, sustainable future.	methane abatement, plasma, catalysts, agriculture, enteric methane, dairy industry	TEKNOLOGIAN TUTKIMUSKESKUS VTT OY	VALIO OY, UNIVERSITEIT ANTWERPEN, UNIVERSITEIT MAASTRICHT, STEINBEIS 2I GMBH	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101069491/program/43108390/details	
The pandemic within: tackling brain vulnerability in COVID19 at high resolution: NEUROCOV (NEUROCOV)	The COVID19 pandemic has shown our health care fragility vis a vis novel pathogens, with a global disruption on societal welfare. Despite the towering success of vaccine development, lack of preparedness on integrative clinical and molecular phenotyping has emerged with clarity and highlights the need to scale translational efforts for personalized prevention and therapy. Of particular concern are the long-term consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection with high and rising prevalence of chronic manifestations referred to as Post-COVID. Among these the neurological and psychiatric complications stand out for frequency, lack of treatment and devastating impact of their effects at pandemic scale. Here, we tackle the cognitive and neurodegenerative complications of COVID-19, referred to as NeuroCOVID, as a ticking pandemic within the pandemic that requires an innovation leap across disciplines. We pursue a multi scalar approach that reaches from epidemiology and mechanistic interrogation of host/virus interplay at single cell resolution through predictive modelling all the way to validation of biomarkers and repurposed drugs. The aim is to anticipate and effectively manage personalized trajectories of NeuroCOVID vulnerability and their impact at population level. For this we leverage two leading national health registries and three clinical cohorts to characterize the phenotypic spectrum of NeuroCOVID, its risk factors and its socioeconomic burden at high definition. We pioneer innovative robotics to scale brain organoid modelling and combine it with single cell multiOMICs and AI analytics to dissect the principles of the individual host response and render experimentally actionable the authentic genetic backgrounds of differential SARS-CoV-2 sensitivity. Through a substantive engagement of patients’ collectives and health care stakeholders, upstream integration of innovative pipelines streamlines translation and operationalizes precision medicine for emerging medical needs.	immune system, nervous system, SARS-CoV2, post-COVID-19, organoids, single cell omics, personalized medicine, risk factors, prediction,epidemiology, genetics, clinical cohorts, health registries, AI	DEUTSCHES ZENTRUM FUR NEURODEGENERATIVE ERKRANKUNGEN EV	FONDAZIONE HUMAN TECHNOPOLE, UNIVERSITA DEGLI STUDI DI MILANO, STICHTING VUMC, HELSINGIN YLIOPISTO, BEN-GURION UNIVERSITY OF THE NEGEV, UMEA UNIVERSITET, HELMHOLTZ ZENTRUM MUENCHEN DEUTSCHES FORSCHUNGSZENTRUM FUER GESUNDHEIT UND UMWELT GMBH, KATHOLIEKE UNIVERSITEIT LEUVEN, EURICE EUROPEAN RESEARCH AND PROJECT OFFICE GMBH	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101057775/program/43108390/details	
Advancing The Clinical Development Of Placental Malaria Vaccines In The Context Of Capacity Building and Use Of Digital Health Technologies (ADVANCE-VAC4PM)	Placental malaria (PM) is a severe disease that affects a particularly vulnerable demographic group, pregnant women. The burden of disease is high, threatening more than 100 million women every year and causing the death of an estimated 50,000 pregnant women and up to 200,000 infants. An effective vaccine would be an attractive tool to control PM on its own, or to complement the existing yet imperfect tools. ADVANCE-VAC4PM will build on the success of previously conducted first-in-human (phase I) clinical studies in Europe and Africa, assessing the two PM vaccine candidates PAMVAC and PRIMVAC. The clinical trial results demonstrated that both adjuvanted vaccine candidates are safe and well-tolerated and induce good homologous immune responses demonstrating the feasibility of developing a PM vaccine. However, prior to embarking on costly, large scale phase II clinical trials, it is essential to optimize the cross-reactivity of the vaccines. Overall project objective is to advance the PM vaccine development and to broaden the immune response by i) increasing the vaccine-induced antibody level by using Virus-Like particles (VLP) to display the PM antigens or ii) by evaluating if a co-administration approach using PRIMVAC and PAMVAC-cVLP will increase cross-reactivity and cross-inhibitory antibody titers. These activities will be embedded in capacity building activities e.g. workshops, training of MSc/PhD students, small competitive research grants to African early career researchers and development of immunology laboratory capacity. In preparation of future PM vaccine trials, digital tools will be evaluated. Pregnancy registers will be developed and the feasibility and acceptability of using mobile applications for tracking pregnancy outcomes will be assessed. Modelling the cost-effectiveness, feasibility and acceptability of PM vaccines will further strengthen the case. Awareness on the need for a PM vaccine will be raised in stakeholder engagement activities.

fuTure hydRogen Assisted gas turbiNeS for effective carbon capTure IntegratiON (TRANSITION)	The achievement of the EU targets established for 2030 for a more sustainable, cost-effective and environmentally-neutral energy production will not only require increasing the penetration of renewable energy sources (RES) into the actual mix, but necessarily point to reduce the carbon footprint of the conventional technologies based on the use of natural gas which is required to complement and compensate intermittent availability of RES. TRANSITION objective is to pave the way for carbon-neutral energy generation from natural gas-fired power plants using gas turbines (GT), by enabling a highly efficient Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) process in the post-combustion phase. This will be achieved by the development of advanced hydrogen assisted combustion technologies capable to permit stable engine operations with high Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) rates leading to high CO2 content in the exhaust gas sent to the CCS unit. Two distinct scenarios will be considered, by i) validating up to TRL4 retrofit hydrogen-based burners targeting 50% EGR rate and ii) proving up to TRL 3 more aggressive technologies adopting hydrogen/oxygen flame piloting to reach 60% EGR. Experimental tests (from atmospheric up to full-engine pressure) will support the technology assessment and the validation of high-fidelity numerical CFD models. Overall CCS-GT system integration will be also carried out with technical and economic analysis. The global sustainability of the proposed technologies will also be investigated to assess environmental/social/economic impacts. TRANSITION outcomes will enable the decarbonisation of GT-based power plants, which are among the most efficient energy thermal generators adopted in several energy-intensive applications. The multi-fuel capabilities and the retrofit opportunity of the developed systems will allow targeting hard-to-decarbonize sectors enabling an efficient transition to a net greenhouse gas neutral EU economy.

Artificial PHOTOsynthesis to produce FUELs and chemicals: hybrid systems with microorganisms for improved light harvesting and CO2 reduction (Photo2Fuel)	The Photo2Fuel project will develop a breakthrough technology that converts CO2 into useful fuels and chemicals by means of non-photosynthetic microorganisms and organic materials, using only sunlight as energy source. Photo2Fuel's technology is based on the artificial photosynthesis concept and will use a hybrid system of non-photosynthetic microorganisms and organic photosensitisers to produce acetic acid and methane, using Moorella thermoacetica (bacteria) and Methanosarcina barkeri (archaea) strains, respectively. After optimisation and characterisation, this hybrid non-photosynthetic microorganisms with organic photosensitiser system will be placed into an auto sufficient photo-micro-reactor running exclusively with sunlight. During the day, the natural sunlight will be used, and, during the night, artificial light will be used from previous stored solar energy in batteries (excess sunlight). This approach will guarantee the continuous operation of the photo-micro-reactor. Additionally, a solar concentrator will be coupled to the reactor to maximise conversion and stabilise the production of fuels and chemicals, even with variant solar flux. The Photo2Fuel project will also investigate technologies for the separation of the main products - acetic acid and methane – and deliver solutions to achieve high separation efficiency. The overall sustainability of the Photo2Fuel's technology will be analysed, including the environmental, economic, and social aspects. Lastly, the market, barriers, and key stakeholders will be analysed from an end-user perspective, aiming at advancing the technology's TRL-4 after the project completion and, thus, actively supporting the transition to a climate neutral Europe by 2050.	solar energy; bacteria; archaea; solar fuels; CO2 reduction; organic semiconductor; solar fuels; artificial photosynthesis; mini-solar plant; products separation; acetic acid; methane; energy storage	IDENER RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT AGRUPACION DE INTERES ECONOMICO	UPPSALA UNIVERSITET, UNIVERSITEIT VAN AMSTERDAM, KNEIA SL, FUNDACION TECNALIA RESEARCH & INNOVATION, Hochschule für angewandte Wissenschaften Landshut	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101069357/program/43108390/details	
Combining Artificial Intelligence and smart sensing TOward better management and improved quality of LIFE in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (TOLIFE)	Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a highly prevalent chronic condition. While COPD is a lung disease, it is mainly the exacerbations and extrapulmonary comorbidities which affect the quality of life, health care costs, and prognosis. The optimal COPD treatment needs to focus on both the characteristics and consequences of the lung disease itself and the diagnosis and treatment of comorbidities. While the severity of lung function impairment is routinely assessed, the exacerbations, the associated comorbidities and limitations in daily life are still significantly underestimated. A personalized approach to COPD management is needed to specifically address the disease, prevent exacerbations, and mitigate its comorbidities to obtain a positive impact on patient health and quality of life. TOLIFE will clinically validate an artificial intelligence (AI) solution to process daily life patient data captured by unobtrusive sensors to enable optimised personalised treatment, assessment of health outcomes and improved quality of life in COPD patients. The TOLIFE approach to COPD management, targeted to predict and mitigate exacerbations and continuously assess the health outcomes, has the potential to reduce mortality, improve health related quality of life and reduce the healthcare costs. TOLIFE will develop and clinically validate an AI-based platform for the early prediction of exacerbations and assessment of the health outcomes. Prediction of exacerbations and assessment of health outcomes will be exploited by clinicians through a patient management tool to perform early and personalized treatment. TOLIFE platform will inform through a disease information tool the patient and caregivers about the patient's health status, the specific treatment plan and lifestyle indications. Two clinical studies will be implemented, one to collect data for AI-tools development and the other to validate the effectiveness of TOLIFE to reduce the risk of exacerbations.

Psych-STRATA - A Stratified Treatment Algorithm in Psychiatry: A program on stratified pharmacogenomics in severe mental illness (Psych-STRATA)	A key problem in Mental Health is that up to one third of patients suffering from major mental disorders develop resistance against drug therapy. However, patients showing early signs of treatment resistance (TR) do not receive adequate early intensive pharmacological treatment but instead they undergo a stepwise trial-and-error treatment approach. This situation originates from three major knowledge and translation gaps: i.) we lack effective methods to identify individuals at risk for TR early in the disease process, ii.) we lack effective, personalized treatment strategies grounded in insights into the biological basis of TR, and iii.) we lack efficient processes to translate scientific insights about TR into clinical practice, primary care and treatment guidelines. It is the central goal of PSYCH-STRATA to bridge these gaps and pave the way for a shift towards a treatment decision-making process tailored for the individual at risk for TR. To that end, we aim to establish evidence-based criteria to make decisions of early intense treatment in individuals at risk for TR across the major psychiatric disorders of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depression. PSYCH-STRATA will i.) dissect the biological basis of TR and establish criteria to enable early detection of individuals at risk for TR based on the integrated analysis of an unprecedented collection of genetic, biological, digital mental health, and clinical data. ii.) Moreover, we will determine effective treatment strategies of individuals at risk for TR early in the treatment process, based on pan-European clinical trials in SCZ, BD and MDD. These efforts will enable the establishment of novel multimodal machine learning models to predict TR risk and treatment response. Lastly, iii.) we will enable the translation of these findings into clinical practice by prototyping the integration of personalized treatment decision support and patient-oriented decision-making mental health boards.

Ammonia and MOF Based Hydrogen storagE for euRope (AMBHER)	AMBHER (Ammonia and MOF based Hydrogen for Europe) is a European project providing a holistic approach to tackle the short and long term energy storage challenges raised by the high degree of electrification our society is aiming for. Firstly, AMBHER is addressing the main societal, economic and technological questions coming together with the use of green ammonia as seasonal renewable energy storage. Simultaneously, AMBHER is developing and demonstrating innovative and cheaper compressed hydrogen storage potentially solving the gap toward local and economically relevant power-to-hydrogen hub. AMBHER will thus increase the number of applications in the energy and transport sectors and the possibilities for success and industrial adoption by key players. For short-term hydrogen storage, novel nanoporous MOFs (Metal Organic Frameworks) of high surface area (>2.500 m2/g) and low cost synthesis will be developed following an original shaping process (3D printing). Furthermore, AMBHER will develop a conformable cryo-vessel that can accommodate stacks of MOF bodies of tailored-made shape. A capacity of 40g/L of usable space at 100 bar is achieved at competitive cost with respect to current high pressure cylinders (600-1.000 euros/kg H2). For long-term storage, advanced materials (both catalysts and membranes) and their combination in an intensified 3D-printed intensified periodic open cell structured reactor will be developed to allow hydrogen storage in the form of ammonia (NH3) in a cost-efficient and resource-effective process at lower temperatures and pressures compared to conventional systems. AMBHER project is validating both short-term and long term solutions at TRL 5 addressing the positioning of the solutions developed in relevant business cases. The project is built around 16 industry and academic leaders in Europe, from 7 different countries. Track record of AMBHER partners proves the synergies and fruitful collaborative nature among all members.

V A L I D A T E - Validation of a Trustworthy AI-based Clinical Decision Support System for Improving Patient Outcome in Acute Stroke Treatment (VALIDATE)	Based on previously developed models and an existing prototype of a clinical decision support system (patent pending), we set out in this project to further develop, test, and validate this clinical decision support for the treatment stratification of acute stroke patients to improve patient outcome. Machine learning (ML)-enabled Artificial intelligence (AI) methods are increasingly adopted in the medical field. Implementing ML-based CDSSs have the potential to be go beyond the current clinical state-of-the-art as AI excels at finding complex and non-linear relationships across a multitude of prognostic variables. AI also has the promise to combine different modalities, such as imaging and clinical values, leading to powerful stratification tools accounting for a multitude of patient sub-populations. Our consortium combines excellence in technical and medical machine learning development with the clinical expertise of three leading stroke hospital partners. Additionally, our consortium benefits from the special expertise in the development of trustworthy AI, software design, and the translation of AI models to the clinical setting with focus on the regulatory process. By leveraging the available medical data and exploiting technological opportunities in the field of AI, and developing and validating trustworthy AI solutions to be implemented in the clinical workflow we are seeking to surpass the clinical state-of-the-art by making a significant and sustainable impact on the treatment of acute stroke that will improve patient survival, outcome and quality of life. The results of our work will serve as a pathway for future projects and we will make our experiences public in the form of standard operating procedures (SOPs) in the areas of development, testing, validation, and regulatory processes.

Respiratory Host-Pathogen Interaction (REACT)	Lower respiratory tract infections resulting from seasonal epidemics and pandemics are among the leading causes of death globally. There is a paucity of treatment options for viral respiratory pathogens and patient care remains largely supportive. This underscores a desperate need for identifying novel targets for prophylactic/treatment interventions and early prediction models of disease outcome to personalise treatment. The REACT consortium ? uniting high-level experts in virology, immunology, clinical medicine, epidemiology, and bioinformatics ? will assess genotypic, high-dimensional immunophenotypic, demographic and clinical data in the context of disease course to define host-pathogen interactions of viral respiratory tract infections, focusing on the predominating viruses i.e. influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In characterised, ethnically diverse clinical cohorts comprising patients with varying disease severities, we will genotype both virus and host, map deep immunological phenotypes spanning cellular, humoral and innate immunity, and characterise host responses in human nasal epithelial organoid models following viral infection. Novel bioinformatics approaches that include knowledge discovery and machine learning will be used to integrate and analyse multidisciplinary datasets to assess the individual and combined impact of factors on disease phenotype. Information on the deep characterisation of the dynamics of the immune responses to the chosen viruses and identified factors critical for viral control and immune protection will be made available on a dedicated project website to clinicians, researchers, health authorities, and public. This will provide direct and immediate access to our findings for further development of personalised treatment, therapeutic targets and vaccines in future trials and clinical practice to improve the wellbeing of the EU population and beyond.

HLA-homozygous iPSC-cardiomyocytE Aggregate manufacturing technoLogies for allogenic cell therapy to the heart (HEAL)	HEAL will focus on general bottlenecks to induced pluripotent stem cell therapies with a particular focus on heart failure, which remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality with very few treatment options. HLA-homozygous cell line derived cardiomyocyte aggregates offer the prospect of a restorative heart therapy applicable to large patient populations and to overcome economic barriers associated with autologous approaches. By developing solutions for their mass-production and cryopreservation we will enable allogeneic treatment with minimum requirements for immunosuppression. Assays for assessment of immunogenicity will provide data for the development of an artificial intelligence powered algorithm to predict recipients's immune responses for personalised design of immunosuppression protocols. A potency assay to assure product effectiveness will be developed together with assays of tumorigenicity in vitro and in vivo that meet and exceed current regulatory requirements. A genetic integrity pipeline defining the most sensitive assays for rigorous assessment will be developed and a rescue tool in the form of a biallelic suicide gene for programmed cell death will add to the safety toolbox for the therapy. Optimisation of cell-product administration in terms of retention and engraftment, including catheter-based delivery as minimally invasive alternative to surgical application, and assessment of risks of graft-induced arrhythmia will be determined in a pig model. Early dialogues, via established links, to the regulatory authorities will ensure proper development according to GMP requirements. Freedom to operate and licensing strategies with a health technology and infrastructure assessment of European centres will set the scene for approval of the cell product and related assays and protocols for storage and distribution required to progress towards a first in man study of cell-based heart repair.

Assessing efficacy and safety of genome EDITing approaches for Sickle Cell Disease (EDITSCD)	Sickle cell disease (SCD) is one of the most prevalent monogenic diseases in Europe. A single amino acid substitution in the beta-globin chain of the adult hemoglobin (Hb) drives red blood cell sickling and multi-organ damage. The clinical severity of SCD is alleviated by the co-inheritance of mutations causing expression of fetal gamma-globin in adult life ? a condition termed hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin (HPFH). Transplantation of autologous, genetically modified hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) is an attractive therapeutic option for SCD patients. To this end, genome editing approaches based on the use of site-specific nucleases or, more recently, base editors have been explored by many groups, including teams in our consortium. These approaches either correct the single point mutation causing SCD or reactivate fetal gamma-globin expression by mimicking HPFH mutations. On the other hand, (pre)clinical data from SCD patients or SCD mouse models, as well as preliminary data from our labs suggest that SCD HSPCs are characterized by a high mutational burden, oxidative stress and expression of inflammatory genes. This can alter HSPC properties as well as their interactions within the bone marrow niche. In the context of gene therapy, it is essential to understand the mechanisms underlying SCD HSPC dysfunction and assess the impact of genome editing approaches on SCD HSPCs. In this proposal, we have assembled a multidisciplinary team to: (i) understand the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying SCD HSPC autonomous and non-cell-autonomous dysfunctions and (ii) evaluate the impact of established and novel genome editing approaches on SCD HSPC properties and genome integrity. This study will lay the foundation of an improved gene therapy strategy to treat SCD and provide best practice tools and protocols for genome editing-based therapies in HSPCs.	genome editing, CRISPR/Cas9, safety	IMAGINE INSTITUT DES MALADIES GENETIQUES NECKER ENFANTS MALADES FONDATION	OSPEDALE SAN RAFFAELE SRL, UNIVERSITAETSKLINIKUM FREIBURG, BAR ILAN UNIVERSITY, INSTITUT NATIONAL DE LA SANTE ET DE LA RECHERCHE MEDICALE, ASTRAZENECA AB, EATRIS ERIC	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101057659/program/43108390/details	
Gene-edited T cells combating IgA Nephropathy. A blueprint approach for safe & efficient genome editing of T cells to sustainably combat several immune diseases and cancers related to B-cell pathology (geneTIGA)	"There is an increasing prevalence of chronic diseases caused by undesired immune reactions (>10%) with high burden for the both patients (chronicity, organ failure, early death, decreased QoL) and society (EU:>100 bn €/a direct health costs) as current therapies are limited in efficacy and do not reshape sustainably the disturbed immune balance. Our ultimative goal is to develop a safe and efficient cell therapy based on genome-edited T cells with redirected specificity to sustainably combat IgA nephropathy (IgAN) - the most common glomerulonephritis and one of the most common causes of end-stage renal disease with unmet medical need. Our specific cell therapy approach is also suitable for other diseases with selective B-cell pathogenesis, such as IgA myeloma, IgA related celiac disease and rheumatoid arthritis, but as a blueprint also for diseases of other Ig classes (e.g. IgG4). Our novel concept offers a specific form of immunosuppression via Ig-(sub)class targeting & glycosylation targeting with redirected T cells in autoimmune diseases. Methodically, we benchmark three promising genome editing technologies, develop new standards for safety assessment and preclinical performance evaluation. At the end we will have a lead candidate of a new ""living drug"" product envisioned as a one-time treatment for IgAN and other IgA-associated that will be ready to enter clinical FIH trials (entry into TRL6). In addition, geneTIGA delivers enabling technology toolboxes with exploitation options beyond of the core project. They might de-risk and accelerate the development of next-generation gene and cell products in general. The project has thus, besides its scientific value, a high impact not only on the affected patients with IgAN and related immune diseases, but also for the European society by reducing the health economic burden caused by progressive chronic kidney disease, as well as by triggering innovation and business options in Europe's biotech and pharma field."	benchmarking genome-editing platform, off-target identification pipeline, redirected T cells, product specification, biomarkers, multiorgan-on-chip, IgA nephropathy, B-cell and plasma cell pathology	CHARITE	UNIVERSITAETSKLINIKUM FREIBURG, TECHNISCHE UNIVERSITAET BRAUNSCHWEIG, OSLO UNIVERSITETSSYKEHUS HF, AARHUS UNIVERSITET, TISSUSE GMBH, CHECKIMMUNE GMBH, Europaischer Nierenpatientenverband, INNOVATION ACTA SRL	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101057438/program/43108390/details	
Risk and Resilience in Developmental Diversity and Mental Health (R2D2-MH)	Individuals with mental health (MH) conditions and their families, especially those with highly prevalent neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), are exposed to high levels of discrimination and stigma, which significantly affects their physical and mental well-being. Our world-leading collaborative group at the forefront of research in NDDs will launch a new project - ?Risk, Resilience and Developmental Diversity in Mental Health? (R2D2-MH). We propose a double paradigm shift to improve the wellbeing of people with MH conditions and their families. We will move (i) from risk-focused studies towards understanding and promoting resilience, and (ii) from a diagnosis-based approach to a developmental diversity approach that will define wellbeing and functioning across the human lifespan. R2D2-MH aims to identify genetic and environmental protective/resilience factors and how they influence developmental diversity and MH. We will investigate at multiple levels two highly prevalent early risks for MH conditions: prematurity and genetic liability for NDDs. Our project has four main ambitions 1. Provide the largest European multi-scale dataset on early human brain development and MH outcomes; 2 Identify biological mechanisms of resilience to the adverse effects of NDD; 3. Co-develop, with the stakeholders, new digital tools to increase participatory research/medicine and reduce stigma; 4. Establish predictive models to guide personalised interventions. R2D2-MH integrates interdisciplinary and complementary expertise across Europe, Israel, and Australia that covers ethics, epidemiology, sociology, genetics, cell biology, neuroscience, computational modelling, Information Technology, psychology, and psychiatry. Our research is highly engaged: it embeds participant and patient involvement in research to ensure that our expected outcomes are truly translational, and will help to reduce stigma and burden for individuals with MH conditions.

Reducing the impact of major environmental challenges on mental health (environMENTAL)	The environMENTAL project will investigate how some of the greatest global environmental challenges, climate change, urbanisation, and psychosocial stress caused by the COVID-19-pandemic affect mental health over the lifespan. It will identify their underlying molecular mechanisms and develop preventions and early interventions. Leveraging cohort data of over 1.5 million European citizens and patients enriched with deep phenotyping data from large scale behavioural neuroimaging cohorts, we will identify brain mechanisms related to environmental adversity underlying symptoms of depression, anxiety, stress and substance abuse. By linking population and patient data via geo-location to spatiotemporal environmental data derived from remote sensing satellites, climate models, regional-socioeconomic data and digital health applications, our interdisciplinary team will develop a neurocognitive model of multimodal environmental signatures related to transdiagnostic symptom groups that are characterised by shared brain mechanisms. We will uncover the molecular basis underlying these mechanisms using multi-modal -omics analyses, brain organoids and virtual brain simulations, thus providing an integrated perspective for each individual across the lifespan and spectrum of functioning. The insight gained will be applied to developing risk biomarkers and stratification markers. We will then screen for pharmacological compounds targeting the molecular mechanisms discovered. We will also reduce symptom development and progression using virtual reality interventions based on the adverse environmental features - developed in close collaboration with stakeholders. Overall, this project will lead to objective biomarkers and evidence-based pharmacologic and VR-based interventions that will significantly prevent and improve outcomes of environmentally-related mental illnesses, and empower EU citizens to manage better their mental health and well-being.

Ocean Cryosphere Exchanges in ANtarctica: Impacts on Climate and the Earth system (OCEAN ICE)	OCEAN:ICE will assess the impacts of key Antarctic Ice Sheet and Southern Ocean processes on Planet Earth, via their influence on sea level rise, deep water formation, ocean circulation and climate. An innovative and ambitious combination of observations and numerical models, including coupled ice sheet-climate model development, will be used to improve predictions of how changes in the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets impact global climate. It will make new circumpolar and Atlantic observations in observational gaps. It will assimilate these and existing data into improved ice sheet boundary conditions and forcing, producing new estimates of ice sheet melt and impacts on ocean circulation, including the Atlantic Meridional Overturning circulation. It will develop, calibrate and assess models used to predict the future evolution of the giant ice sheets. It will reduce the deep uncertainty in the impact of their melt on societally relevant environmental changes on decadal to multi-centennial time scales. OCEAN:ICE will assess the potential for passing ice sheet 'tipping points' and their consequences for ocean circulation and climate. OCEAN:ICE will raise the profile of European research through its extensive network of international collaborators, who provide scientific and logistical support. It will directly contribute to the All-Atlantic Ocean Research Alliance through observations, logistical collaboration and analysis. It will significantly advance the state-of-the-art in coupled ice sheet-climate modelling and directly contribute to international climate assessments such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and World Ocean Assessment. It will link organically to European data centres to disseminate its data, following FAIR and INSPIRE principles. It will deliver improved assessments of European climate impacts from the melting ice sheets, with actionable risk and timescales, to policymakers and the public.

NUTRIBUDGET - Optimisation of nutrient budget in agriculture. (NutriBudget)	In line with the Zero Pollution action plan and the Farm to Fork Strategy, Nutribudget will develop the prototype of a first-of-its-kind integrated nutrient management platform, called Nutriplatform, in various regions across Europe. The Nutriplatform will operate as a decision-support tool (DST) for farmers, advisors and regional authorities and before the end of the project this prototype (as a stand-alone or integrated in the existing EC promoted FaST tool for nutrient management) will be tested and used by at least 40.000 farmers across Europe. Firstly, the development of the Nutriplatform will be based on the algorithms of two advanced newly developed holistic Nutrimodels that quantify the impact of agronomic mitigation measures to optimize nutrient budget and flow across scales (from farm to Europe), across elements (C) and nutrients (N, P, K, S, Ca, Mg, Cu and Zn) and by looking at various agronomic and environmental targets. The measures will be derived from (I) existing knowledge, including input from relevant EU projects (e.g. the 4 on nutrient recycling from the call) and (II) new data from field experiments with innovative mitigation measures and combinations thereof that connect animal and crop production via agro-processing industries in 5 pilot regions (4 nutrient hotspot and 1 nutrient deficient area) in 4 different climate regions in Europe. Secondly, these measures will be linked to relevant monitoring indicators, called NutriKPIs, for agronomic performance in different farming systems, nutrient emissions and impact on biodiversity. All will be done in co-creation, according to a Nutri-actor approach, with a consortium of 17 partners from 10 countries that are all experts in their respective fields. Thereby, Nutribudget will contribute to systemically optimize nutrient management across different agricultural production systems and regions in the EU to reduce pollution due to the excessive use of nutrients and nutrient losses to the environment.

Green H2 and circular bio-coal from biowaste for cost-competitive sustainable Steel (H2STEEL)	The achievement of the Net-zero emissions target established by the European Commission is huge challenge which could not be achieved without re-thinking the conventional route (materials and energy chains). H2STEEL project proposes an innovative, disruptive solution to convert wet waste streams into green Hydrogen, Carbon and Critical Raw Materials. The proposed innovative solution aims at supporting the green transition of one of the most hard-to-abate industrial sector: metallurgy. In particular, H2STEEL combines the conversion of biowaste and bioCH4 through innovative catalyzed pyrolysis with chemical leaching, to fully convert biowastes into Green Hydrogen, Green Carbon (biocoal), and recovery of Critical (inorganic) Raw Materials. Biomethane pyrolysis is carried out in a brand new, ad-hoc designed, and proof-of-concept reactor, on a bed of biocoal made from pre-carbonized biowastes, i.e. on a very cheap fully carbon-based catalyst, very resistant to temperature and contaminants: this will enhance the efficiency of the methane cracking step to generate Green Hydrogen. As new solid carbon from methane cracking is generated on the biocoal surface, thus reducing the performance of the catalyst, new biocoal-catalyst is inserted in the reactor, while the spent biocoal is removed: the continuous renewal of the catalyst is feasible thanks to its low cost, and to the market value of the spent catalyst. This material, fully bio-carbon based, is then used in steel-making as a substitute of metallurgical (fossil) coke, generating a net GHG reduction, EU ETS (Emission Trading Scheme) compliant. The regeneration of the spent catalyst thus becomes unnecessary, as the biocoal is used in a downstream process, avoiding the release of CO2 in atmosphere (as it happens in the SMR process or in most of the catalysts regeneration steps).

Innovative methodology to prevent and mitigate diffuse pollution from urban water runoff (WATERUN)	WATERUN project aims to develop an innovative methodology to contribute to the implementation of urban water runoff management plans in cities based on the Water-Sensitive Urban Design concept. This methodology will provide preventive and mitigation solutions and best management practices adopting a holistic perspective (from source identification to remediation strategies) for diffuse water pollution control in urban catchments. The target is to transform the urban water runoff management by the development of identification, planning and risk-based tools and new working procedures (guidance), counting on the early involvement of the main urban water management and governance actors (co-creation process) to ensure a wider and faster adoption. Three case studies (city of Santiago de Compostela, city of Aarhus and city of Amman) have been chosen to obtain data and to elaborate, perform and validate the proposed WATERUN methodology. These case studies have been selected according to different climate conditions, land use and level of implementation of measures for diffuse pollution, in order to validate the tools in different scenarios. Key stakeholders as RTO, industry, public authorities, urban planners and citizens will participate in a continuous co-creation process from a multi-disciplinary approach ensuring that decisions for urban water runoff management are made with complete comprehension of environmental, social and economic dimensions. In addition to providing solutions for sustainable urban water management, the WATERUN methodology will allow to gain advanced knowledge on diffuse water pollution in cities in a climate change context, thus contributing to protect water bodies and the environment, and ensuring high water quality for all.	diffuse pollution, urban water runoff, stormwater, water management, Green infrastructure, climate change, monitoring, modelling, decision-support system.

Flexible, Safe and efficient REcycling of Li-ion batterieS for a comPetitive, circular, and sustainable European battery manufaCTuring industry (RESPECT)	In the context of increasing global battery use, developing sustainable, safe and efficient processes is a tangible issue to further enhance circular economy and strategic autonomy of the European Li-ion batteries value chain, in line with the battery partnership’s objectives launched under Horizon Europe. RESPECT main objective is to develop a global process encompassing a process-chain flexible enough to treat all kind of batteries in closed loop, considering the variability of Li-ion batteries chemistries (NMC, LFP, NCA, LMO) , applications (EV and ESS) and states (aged, damaged, EoL, production scraps) up to date not covered by any process on the State of the Art. RESPECT addresses two recycling routes: full hydrometallurgy and direct recycling and an improved Life Cycle Assessment of each recycling segment to lower emissions and reduce secondary pollution, safety and health risks. RESPECT will aim to design and validate the recycling processes up to pilot scale to recovering the highest amount of resources, including CRMs and active materials present in the batteries to closing the loop by their reuse in cathode and anode materials for new batteries. Socio-economic, as well as sustainability aspects will be covered throughout the project. To ensure a successful project implementation, knowledge sharing on Li-ion battery green recycling processes will be fostered, based on the engagement with relevant international stakeholders and experts through the advisory board. Based on a solid and interdisciplinary consortium of partners covering the whole value chain, RESPECT seeks high recovery rates (for Li, Mn, Co, Ni or graphite) with low environmental impact and strong energy savings, in accordance with the European Green Deal and the proposed Battery Regulation.

Safe System for radical improvement of road safety in low- and middle-income African countries (AfroSAFE)	The primary objective of the AfroSAFE project is to make a significant progress in propagation of the Safe System modus operandi within the road safety work context in African countries. This is reached by exposing the local practitioners and decision makers to the state-of-the-art knowledge and practices within road safety management based on Safe System principles, as well as supporting them by sharing necessary knowledge, tools and methods for road safety improvement—adjusted to the African conditions and in tight cooperation with the local actors. More specifically, this is reached through mapping of the existing regulations, procedures, methods and tools within all five pillars of road safety (management, safe infrastructure, safe vehicles, safe road users and post-crash care), development of the recommendations for improvements and running a series of pilots and demonstrations to illustrate these recommendations in action. In these activities, the problems and needs of the vulnerable road users will receive particular attention. Another focus area for the AfroSAFE project is capacity building through education of the local educators in all areas relevant for road safety. Together with them, the current curriculums are revised, new educational programmes created, and an educational platform—a virtual centre of excellence—will be created.

Creating leverage to enhance biodiversity outcomes of global biomass trade (CLEVER)	CLEVER identifies new leverage points for sustainable transformation informed by a novel holistic approach to quantify biodiversity and other impacts of trade in major raw and processed non-food biomass value chains. In line with Pillars 3 & 4 of the EU Biodiversity Strategy 2030, we address all outcomes of this topic by adopting perspectives at the system and value chain levels. At the system level, we improve our understanding of leakage effects in the non-food biomass trade system informed by quasi-experimental evaluation techniques, quantitative scenario modelling, and policy case studies. At the value chain level, CLEVER engages with key stakeholders (i.e., producers, traders, retailers, civil society, and policy makers) in R&I co-design to identify leverage points for transformative change at corporate and institutional levels. Value chain analyses will produce ‘ecological footprints’ from advanced life cycle analyses and enhance our understanding of actor-specific behavior focusing on trade in soy, timber, wood pulp, and fishmeal/oil between Europe, South America, and Central Africa. Further CLEVER products and tools to influence decision-making at the right level include (1) improved indicators of biodiversity loss to inform business and policy, (2) enhanced features for the global modelling platform GLOBIOM to quantify trade-mediated leakage and SDG interdependencies in biomass value chains, and (3) an innovation action pool to support public and private decision-makers in choosing governance instruments that effectively enhance biodiversity and promote climate change mitigation and adaptation. Building on prior and ongoing engagement of its members at the science-policy interface and through partnerships with other projects under the destination on biodiversity and ecosystem services, the consortium will leverage CLEVER knowledge and tools to strengthen IPBES and IPCC and enhance science-industry cooperation for sustainable bioeconomic transformation.

Coherent and cross-compliant ocean governance for delivering the EU Green Deal for European Seas (CrossGov)	The three-year CrossGov project aims to enhance knowledge on how coherence and cross-compliance of marine related policies and legislation affect the ability to realise the goals of the EU Green Deal for the protection of marine ecosystems and biodiversity, and to co-create proposals and roadmaps towards this end. A core strength of CrossGov is the close collaboration with the policymaking community that will be engaged in co-creation of knowledge and recommendations for solutions. The background for the project is the complex multi-level and multi-sector governance system created by global and regional international frameworks, the EU and the European coastal states. This policy landscape has not managed to halt the degradation of European seas and will be challenged further by the EU Green Deal’s call for transformative changes. Based on scenarios and methodological guidance for studies of coherence, cross-compliance and scientific advice, the project will analyse how policies and legislation at various levels support or impede progress towards the Green Deal in the marine domain. The practical results of attempts to implement the various requirements will be studied in three regional cases (the North Sea, the Baltic and the Mediterranean), and in five national cases (Finland, Norway, Netherlands, France, Italy). The insights gained will be discussed with CrossGov’s Stakeholder Forum to co-create recommendations for better integrated policies towards implementing the Green Deal in the marine context. The innovative, web-based and fit-for purpose roadmaps and methodological guidelines will enable policymakers to effectively foster environmentally sustainable law and governance that is fit-for-purpose for delivering the societal transformation called for.

GreenH2 production from water and bioalcohols by full solar spectrum in a flow reactor (GH2)	Water splitting for H2 production driven by solar energy is quite attractive while the current efficiency is very moderate due to both the extremely sluggish water oxidation half reaction and limited light harvesting (mostly UV-visible light). In addition, the separation of one product H2 from the other O2 during water splitting is very costly. The project is designed to address these challenges by i) utilizing the full solar spectrum (300-2500nm) instead of UV-visible light (300-700nm), ii) coupling water splitting with biomass-derivative oxidation to avoid water oxidation, iii) well combining solid Z-scheme UV-visible photocatalysis and Infrared-driven thermal catalysis, and iv) using a flow double tube reactor other than batch reactors, thus targeting to produce green H2 from both water and biomass with a high quantum yield of 60% . Furthermore the project will co-produce high-value chemicals with a high selectivity of >90%. In addition, the integration of low-cost and efficient catalysts with novel flow reactors will assure a continuous and efficient production of H2 and high-value chemicals. The entire process does not use fossil fuels nor produce CO2, thus a zero carbon-emission technology. Finally the system can be readily scaled up by numbering up the reactor modules. All these are built upon a multidisciplinary and international consortium with the global experts in photocatalysis, thermal catalysis, reactor engineering, product separation, simulation and social science. Therefore the scientific and technical challenges, as well as the environmental, societal and economic impacts will be fully addressed in the project. The proposed technology will typically benefit the EU economy by an innovative green H2 production process from water and biomass, heavily contributing to a low carbon society. In addition, the international team including members from Asia will facilitate the technology exploitation out of the EU, to further benefit the EU economy.

Flexible and hybrid manufacturing of green aluminium to produce tailored adaptive crash-tolerant structures (FLEXCRASH)	Flexcrash aims to develop a flexible and hybrid manufacturing technology based on applying surface patterns by additive manufacturing onto preformed parts. Aluminium alloys have been selected as the optimum material to build high performance structures, addressing both lightweight and environmental sustainability. They provide better recyclability, affordability (low CRM content), and costs than other material alternatives that would need complex developments for joining, recycling, and manufacturing. The property tailoring capacity offered by hybrid manufacturing will permit to develop a new type of crash-tolerant structures with outstanding performance under a wide range of impact angles and unexpected crash conditions. Structures will be defined according to the collision parameters identified by the different mixed traffic scenarios. Such tailored structures are the ideal solutions for dynamic active safety devices that allows displacement of crash structures to optimally face an imminent crash. Considering that the frontal crash is the most common (70%), a front-end structure has been chosen as demonstrator to validate the manufacturing developments, the modelling approach and the testing methodologies. The flexibility of the proposed technology will facilitate its transferability to other safety-related structures in vehicle’s locations with higher risk for passenger’s injuries while decreasing the number of materials and processes used to manufacture a crash structure. Simplify supply chain will turn into 20% manufacturing costs saving and reduce the risk of disruption. Virtual testing with improved reliability, validated by crash tests, will be used to propose new testing configurations, looking at the next step towards standardization. The application of Flexcrash solutions to the whole BiW offers a lightweighting potential up to 20% with improved safety (toward 50% reduction of passenger’s injuries and fatalities).

Explaining and Predicting the Ocean Conveyor (EPOC)	EPOC will generate a new conceptual framework for the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation, to understand how it functions in the Earth system and impacts weather and climate. The AMOC is a key component of the climate system, responsible for ocean heat and freshwater transport, associated with the ventilation of anthropogenic carbon, and anticipated to experience or drive climate tipping points. However, the link between ocean transport, ventilation and tipping points relies on the common conceptual view of the AMOC as a ‘great ocean conveyor’ which was developed to explain very long timescale (glacial-interglacial) fluctuations in climate. The conveyor-belt schematic conflates millennial timescales with human timescales (days to 100 years), leading to misconceptions by the observing and modelling communities, and misplaced expectations about the AMOC’s role in climate. EPOC will capitalise on new understanding about the AMOC variability and coherence from two decades of AMOC observations and advances in ocean observing technology and climate modelling, to develop new tools and approaches to quantify and explain past AMOC change and how its connectivity or lack thereof imprint on the Earth system. Through joined-up observational and model experiments, focussing on next generation high resolution coupled models, machine learning techniques and critical re-assessment of paleo proxies, EPOC will generate a new conceptual framework for the AMOC, its meridional connectivity, feedbacks and the relationship between ventilation and overturning on human timescales. This will lead to better predictions of the AMOC and related climate evolution, including the risk of rapid change.

EU-China joint action to increase development and adoption of IPM tools (ADOPT-IPM)	The continuous stream of invasive agricultural pests and chronic re-emergence of key ones prompt for implementation of Integrated Pest Management (IPM) tools, but often main management methods rely largely on chemical pesticides. However, their widespread use is highlighted as a key threat to human health and wildlife. Much progress made in the conception of IPM tools in the past decade however, despite EU and Chinese policies prompting use of IPM, widespread adoption by farmers is slowed down by key barriers, notably because many available non-chemical IPM tools (a) have not been optimized (lack reliability or effectiveness), (b) are sub-optimal when combined together in IPM packages as not developed via an integrated approach, and (c) are missing for particular key pests. In this context the project will exploit the thorough knowledge accumulated on pest management methods to adapt and optimize IPM tools and practices which did not reach the field/market yet, or that are currently not efficient enough. In addition, ADOPT-IPM will work on the further development of high potential IPM tools, and will design optimized cost-effective environment-sound IPM packages. The choice of crops and pests in ADOPT-IPM (tomato, leafy vegetables, wheat, and maize) is based on their economic importance in Europe and China and for their current pest management methods relying largely on chemical pesticides. The project is structured in 3 R&D WPs, one for field demonstrations, one for dissemination and one for project management. The consortium has been selected to integrate early in the research process the main end-users of the project’s results (farmers associations, SMEs and key stakeholders). The EU-China consortium also has a strong coverage of experts (and based on many long-term collaborations), to take advantage of the experience of each region and to more efficiently adapt the IPM tools, practices and packages to the specific problems of European and Chinese farmers.	predator, parasitoid, biopesticide, stripcropping, RNAi, banker plant, compost, biostimulant, push-pull, tomato, maize, wheat, leafy vegetable, aphid, disease, lepidoptera, mealybug, thrips, weed	INSTITUT NATIONAL DE RECHERCHE POUR L'AGRICULTURE, L'ALIMENTATION ET L'ENVIRONNEMENT	AARHUS UNIVERSITET, AGRINEWTECH SRL, AGRIODOR, AGROBIO SL, ARCADIA INTERNATIONAL GEIE, ACTA ASSOCIATION DE COORDINATION TECHNIQUE AGRICOLE, CAB INTERNATIONAL, IF TECH, INRAE TRANSFERT SAS, INSTITUT DE RECERCA I TECNOLOGIA AGROALIMENTARIES, UNIVERSITA DEGLI STUDI DI CATANIA, UNIVERSITEIT GENT, UNIVERSITE DE LIEGE, STICHTING WAGENINGEN RESEARCH, WAGENINGEN UNIVERSITY	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101060430/program/43108390/details	
Integrating Adaptive Learning in Maritime Simulator-Based Education and Training with Intelligent Learning System (i-MASTER)	While all educational sectors have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, the vocational-oriented academic training components in higher education sectors have been more severely affected than others. For undergraduate and graduate students currently studying for a career at sea, the pandemic has led to suspension to their simulator training sessions, vocational learning opportunities and future careers. The simulator-based education and training domain, which forms the platform of skilled manpower supply for the maritime industry, is facing this unprecedented challenge to ensure the continuity of the educational activities and to cope with the constraints imposed by the pandemic. High-quality vocational education is the cornerstone of effective youth transitions into the labour market for the European society. The suspension of simulator-based training and tutoring sessions has led to concerns regarding whether the higher and vocational educational institutes can produce a sufficient and competent workforce who could adequately carry out on-board navigation functions safely and efficiently in the near future. By accounting for the needs, knowledge gaps and challenges faced by today’s maritime education and training sector, the i-MASTER project aims to integrate emerging technologies in vocational education and training to develop an innovative Intelligent Learning System (ILS) with maritime learning analytics and adaptive learning function to facilitate both remote and on-site maritime simulator-based education and training. The i-MASTER solution will significantly enhance the effectiveness and accessibility of simulator-based education in the European society and further improve safety, security and performance of maritime operations of the future.

HUMAN-ROBOT SENSORIMOTOR AUGMENTATION - WEARABLE SENSORIMOTOR INTERFACES AND SUPERNUMERARY ROBOTIC LIMBS FOR HUMANS WITH UPPER-LIMB DISABILITIES (HARIA)	HARIA re-defines the nature of physical human-robot interaction (HRI), laying the foundations of a new research field, i.e., human sensorimotor augmentation, whose constitutive elements are: i) AI-powered wearable and grounded supernumerary robotic limbs and wearable sensorimotor interfaces; ii) methods for augmentation enabling users to directly control and feel the extra limbs exploiting the redundancy of the human sensorimotor system through wearable interfaces; iii) clear target populations, i.e., chronic stroke and spinal cord injured individuals, and real-world application scenarios to demonstrate the extraordinary value of the paradigm shift that HARIA represents in HRI and the great impact on the motivation to re-use the paretic arm(s), with consequent improvement of the quality of life. Supernumerary limbs will be partially controlled by artificial intelligence, and partially under the direct control of the human who gains the agency of some motion parameters of the supernumerary limbs. From the control point of view, it is fundamental to find the right trade-off between motion task parameters that are controlled by the user, and the level of robot autonomy. This interplay is enabled by the wearable sensorimotor interface that establishes a connection between the human sensorimotor system and the system of actuators and sensors of the robot, allowing reciprocal awareness, trustworthiness and mutual understanding. HARIA finds its natural application in assisting people with uni- or bi-lateral upper limbs chronic motor disabilities. Technology and methodology developments will follow a user-centered design approach, as only patients with disabilities are fully aware of their real (still unmet) needs in real life activities. This project will also go beyond the application to health, starting a new era of intuitive and seamless human-robot augmentation by wearable sensorimotor interfaces and supernumerary limbs.

SAFE AND EXPLAINABLE CRITICAL EMBEDDED SYSTEMS BASED ON AI (SAFEXPLAIN)	Deep Learning (DL) techniques are key for most future advanced software functions in Critical Autonomous AI-based Systems (CAIS) in cars, trains and satellites. Hence, those CAIS industries depend on their ability to design, implement, qualify, and certify DL-based software products under bounded effort/cost. There is a fundamental gap between Functional Safety (FUSA) requirements of CAIS and the nature of DL solutions needed to satisfy those requirements. The lack of transparency (mainly explainability and traceability), and the data-dependent and stochastic nature of DL software clash against the need for deterministic, verifiable and pass/fail test-based software solutions for CAIS. SAFEXPLAIN tackles this challenge by providing a novel and flexible approach to allow the certification – hence adoption – of DL-based solutions in CAIS by (1) architecting transparent DL solutions that allow explaining why they satisfy FUSA requirements, with end-to-end traceability, with specific approaches to explain whether predictions can be trusted, and with strategies to reach (and prove) correct operation, in accordance with certification standards. SAFEXPLAIN will also (2) devise alternative and increasingly complex FUSA design safety patterns for different DL usage levels (i.e. with varying safety requirements) that will allow using DL in any CAIS functionality, for varying levels of criticality and fault tolerance. SAFEXPLAIN brings together a highly skilled and complementary consortium to successfully tackle this endeavor including 3 research centers, RISE (AI expertise), IKR (FUSA expertise), and BSC (platform expertise); and 3 CAIS case studies, automotive (NAV), space (AIKO), and railway (IKR). SAFEXPLAIN DL-based solutions are assessed in an industrial toolset (EXI). Finally, to prove that transparency levels are fully compliant with FUSA, solutions are reviewed by internal certification experts (EXI), and external ones subcontracted for an independent assessment.

Strengthening Understanding and Strategies of business To Assess and Integrate Nature (SUSTAIN)	Our global economy is intrinsically dependent on nature, and at the same time is playing a major role in its degradation. Recognition of this fact has grown substantially in the past decade, as evidenced in the EU Biodiversity strategy for 2030. However, transformative, system-wide changes are still needed to achieve the nature-positive outcomes required to 'bend the curve' of biodiversity loss. While the business case for economic actors to address biodiversity is becoming clearer in some sectors, it is still lacking in others, particularly those more removed from direct interactions with nature. SUSTAIN (Strengthening Understanding and Strategies of business To Assess and Integrate Nature) will bring together a multi-stakeholder and multi-disciplinary team to strengthen understanding and awareness of how all economic activities depend and impact on biodiversity. The project will build on existing work within the business and biodiversity space to develop and validate a database of business dependencies and impacts, develop methods that actors can use to reduce biodiversity-related risks, and a toolbox to support their application. The consortium will drive uptake of these resources through dissemination of targeted business case materials, drawing on existing networks and expertise in communicating with businesses, financial institutions and other key stakeholders.	biodiversity, ecosystem services, private sector, measurement, monitoring, reporting	STICHTING CAPITALS COALITION	MINISTERIE VAN INFRASTRUCTUUR EN WATERSTAAT, UICN, BUREAU DE REPRESENTATION AUPRES DE L'UNION EUROPEENNE AISBL, FUNDACION BIODIVERSIDAD	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101060320/program/43108390/details	
Circular Economy Applied To Electronic Printed Circuit Boards Based On Paper (CircEl-Paper)	The amount of e-waste correctly recycled does not meet the targets set by the EC. The objective of CircEl-Paper is to increase the amount of e-waste recycling by feeding it in the paper recycling process that is much more accepted by the consumer. Therefore, CircEl-Paper focusses on the widely used board technology (Printed Circuit Board PCB) and aims for replacing the fiber-composite core material FR4 by paper technology. Based on positive experiences in manufacturing of circuitry on paper, integration density has to be increased and sound evaluation of separation of used electronic materials in the recycling process has to be carried out. In order to transfer the PCB technology to circular economy each process step (lamination, gluing/soldering, manufacturing of vertical interconnects, encapsulation etc..) is scrutinized and alternative approaches are developed in order to increase the part of the materials that are recyclable , are bio-based, come from secondary raw materials or are at least harmless for the environment. Three different use cases in the field of medical application, logistics and consumer electronics, are realized demonstrating the performance of the paper-based PCB. The CircEl-Paper project is carried out by 3 RTO : Fraunhofer (project coordinator), Joanneum, RISE, that care about novel material approaches and adaptation of process techniques.

The REXASI-PRO project aims to release a novel engineering framework to develop greener and Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence solutions. In the methodology, safety, security, and explainability are entangled. In addition, throughout the entire lifecycle of the framework, ethics aspects will be continuously monitored. To this end, the REXASI-PRO project introduces several novelties. The project will develop in parallel the design of novel trustworthy-by-construction solutions for social navigations and a methodology to certify the robustness of AI-based autonomous vehicles for people with reduced mobility. The trustworthy-by-construction social navigation algorithms will exploit mathematical models of social robots. The robots will be trained by using both implicit and explicit communication. REXASI-PRO methodology augments existing system-level and item-level engineering frameworks by leveraging novel eXplainability methods to improve the entire system's robustness. REXASIPRO will release additional verification and validation approaches for safety and security with the AI in the loop. Among the other developments, a novel learning paradigm embeds safety requirements in Deep Neural Network for planning algorithms, runtime monitoring based on conformal prediction regions, trustable sensing, and secure communication. The methodology will be used to certify the robustness of both autonomous wheelchairs and flying robots. The flying robots will be equipped with unbiased machine learning solutions for people detection that will be reliable also in an emergency. Thus, REXASI-PRO will make the AI solutions greener. To this end, both an AI-based orchestrator to augment the intelligence of the robots and topological methods will be developed. The REXASI-PRO framework will be demonstrated by enabling the collaboration among autonomous wheelchairs and flying robots to help people with reduced mobility.

CONtext-aware VerifIable dyNamiC dEliberation (CONVINCE)	In recent years, robots are being increasingly deployed outside strictly controlled environments. When faced with unexpected situations, these robots are often incapable of taking appropriate action and require human intervention. The goal of CONVINCE is to advance the capabilities of robots to perform complex tasks robustly and safely within unstructured environments via autonomous and unsupervised adaptation to the environment and operational context. More specifically, the key contribution is to develop cognitive deliberation capabilities that ensure safe robot operation over extended periods of time without human intervention. These capabilities will be integrated into a model-driven software toolchain to allow developers to build application-specific deliberation systems able to i) determine robot’s behaviors required to fulfill a given task, also taking into account the context in which the robot operates and the experience gained during previous executions of the same task, ii) deploy and configure the components that are required to execute these behaviors, iii) automate the analysis of behaviors to ensure that they are safe and secure, leveraging on formal models and tools for design-time and run-time verification. The toolchain shall be based on proven system modeling concepts, particularly from the EU-funded project RobMoSys. Major parts shall be open-sourced with adapters to relevant robotics frameworks like the Robot Operating System (ROS). To ensure real-world applicability, CONVINCE will demonstrate the technology developed in the project on three different real-world use cases, each of which presents unique technical difficulties and utilizes robotic systems of increasing complexity, in different application domains: vacuum cleaner robot, assembly robot, and robotic museum guide.

Innovative and Sustainable High Voltage Li-ion Cells for Next Generation (EV) Batteries (IntelLiGent)	The IntelLiGent project answers to the need for general public acceptance of EVs, by facilitating the industrial deployment of next-generation batteries allowing for an increased driving range, fast charging capabilities, low cost and increased safety. IntelLiGent will develop European generation 3b high voltage (>4.7 V) LIBs with increased energy density (>350-400 Wh/kg, 750-1000 Wh/l), charge acceptance (>2C) and cycle-life (>2000 deep cycles) compared to the state-of-the-art, while reducing cost (<100 €/kWh on pack level) and carbon footprint of the produced cells. The ambitious goals will be realized through optimized cells produced with; - High-voltage spinel LNMO cathode materials engineered to enhance stability and enable aqueous processing whilst exploring strategies to increase specific capacity beyond the theoretical maximum of standard LNMO - Energy efficient high-capacity stable Si-Gr anodes delivering 850 mAh/g - High-voltage electrolytes with innovative additives that form protective layers on the anode and the cathode - Self-mitigating and healing binders and separators minimize parasitic reactions and degradation - Novel open-source modelling tools and high-throughput screening will be employed to accelerate the development of environmentally benign materials with minimized use of critical raw materials -Optimized electrode design (≥4.5 mAh/cm2) and cell design-based commercial-scale automotive cells (20 Ah) as well as battery modules (1 kWh) at TRL 6 From an industrial viewpoint, a prerequisite for succeeding is continuity in battery R&D&I projects and training/education of required staff, which IntelLiGent will foster by broad dissemination and exploitation of the project results across the battery value chain. The project will result in strengthening of the European battery value chain by developing European industries with leading-edge technologies on battery materials, and allowing for accelerated roll-out of electrification for mobility.

Renewable and flexible fuel power generation technology enabling the multi-sectorial decarbonization with Zero emissions (ALL-IN Zero)	EU transport and power generation accounts approximately each for one-third of all CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion. While current decarbonisation measures are focused principally on two alternatives: electrification and fuel switching, these are not suitable for the harder-to-abate sectors, such as heavy-duty road transport or decentralised energy production due to payload, autonomy and/or fuel supply requisites, among other issues. In fact, these sectors still rely on fossil fuels for 94% of its energy needs, constituting one of the main challenges to comply with the objectives of the Paris Agreement. These sectors require a system that allows to exploit the advantages of the use of liquid fuels, as are high energy density, fast refilling and easy transport, but bypassing the efficiency limitations and eliminating CO2 emissions. In addition, to tackle the alarming increase of GHG emissions and the rise of global temperature, it is necessary to deploy an effective solution in the short-medium term. Therefore, it is key not to depend on the construction of new infrastructures and be able to use the existing ones for the transport, storage and supply of liquid fuels. The main objective of ALL-IN Zero is to develop a multi-fuel system to generate electrical and mechanical power with zero emissions. This system will feed low, zero or carbon carbon-negative fuels like ammonia, natural gas, biogas or alcohols, into a Compact Membrane Reactor producing a common intermediate temporary energy vector to be consumed in situ by power generation systems such as internal combustion engines and fuel cells. ALL-IN Zero will accelerate decarbonisation earlier than other technologies, using available productive and supply chains, SoA technologies, and upstream and downstream treatments for mobile and stationary solutions.

Targeting cancer with mutanome based stem cell vaccine (MUTAVAC)	The successful application of immune checkpoints inhibitors has modified the therapeutic strategies in several cancers but only 30% of patients will respond optimally to these therapies. One of the reasons for the failure of these therapies is the resistance of cancer stem cells (CSCs) leading to relapses long after the initial treatment. These cells are also resistant to conventional therapies via their quiescence and there are no targeted therapies available against them. The ambition of IPSIRIUS, a French biotechnology company, spinoff of INSERM and Paris Saclay University is to develop active cancer immunotherapy products based on the revolutionary induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology. IPSIRIUS developed first IPVAC, with the aim of leveraging patient’s immune system against a large panel of cancer antigens which are shared between iPSC and CSCs. With IPVAC, IPSIRIUS is developing a ground-breaking technology, having resolved all technical issues limiting cell-based therapies used for cancer. IPVAC is a safe, allogenic, off-the-shelf therapy, highly scalable using a versatile technology. This cell-based vaccination strategy showed efficacy in prophylactic and therapeutic settings against aggressive solid cancers with stemness features. The overall goal of the MUTAVAC project is i) to uncover the mechanisms of action of IPVAC, ii) to generate a highly immunogenic version of IPVAC, and iii) to design robust in vitro immunogenicity tests to predict immunogenicity of IPVAC and IPVAC-Mut in humans. With MUTAVAC project, IPSIRIUS will i) strengthen the scientific data on IPVAC to prepare its clinical development and leading to the open access publications and patents, ii) define a personalised medicine to propose efficient therapeutic cancer vaccine in patients with all HLA groups, iii) identify new targets for future cancer therapies, and iv) develop a technological platform to facilitate the development of the next-generation of cell therapies.	induced pluripotent stem cells, cancer stem cells, immunotherapy vaccine	IPSIRIUS		https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101071140/program/43108390/details	
MAGNONIC ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORKS AND GATE ARRAYS (MANNGA)	We seek to explore and challenge the limits of spin-based devices and their energy efficiency. This will be achieved by combining two inherently energy-efficient technology paradigms: (i) magnonics (using spin waves – low energy magnetic excitations – to process signals and data) and (ii) neuromorphic computing (using large-scale integrated systems and analog circuits to solve data-driven problems in a brain-like manner). We will use nanoscale chiral magnonic resonators as building blocks of artificial neural networks. The power of the networks will be demonstrated by creating magnonics versions of field programmable gate arrays, reservoir computers, and recurrent neural networks. The ultimate efficiency of the devices will be achieved by (a) maximising their magnetic nonlinearity; (b) using epitaxial yttrium iron garnet, which has the lowest known magnetic damping, for thin film magnonic media and resonators; and (c) using wireless delivery of power. Sensitive to the resonators’ micromagnetic states, such artificial neural networks will be conveniently programmable and trainable within existing paradigms of magnetic data storage. The latter includes magnetic random-access memory (MRAM), which is already compatible with CMOS, while compatibility with other technology paradigms of spintronics will also be sought, explored, and exploited. Thereby, the key ambition of our proposed very forward-looking research programme is to develop and establish a novel, revolutionary class of energy-efficient spin-based components and devices for use in green high-tech data communication, processing, and storage technologies, thereby helping unlock the full potential of spintronics. We will seek dissemination of our developed and appropriately protected designs, processes, and technologies to interested European and international companies, thereby improving the competitiveness of the European high-tech industry.

Cognitive robotic tools for human-centered small-scale multi-robot operations (REGO)	Robots are still often regarded as large machines with links, gears, and electric motors, autonomously interacting with the surrounding environment. Despite the great research efforts in robotics and human-robot interaction (HRI), the way we design, use, and control robots has not fundamentally changed in the past 20 years. We see in small-scale wireless multi-robot systems and cognitive HRI a revolutionary answer to nowadays robots limitations. Instead of large, tethered machines, that are difficult for the human user to control, REGO proposes an innovative set of AI-powered, modular, microsized swarms of robots. They are wirelessly steered by electromagnetic fields as well as able to react to other external stimuli, and then naturally controlled by humans through intuitive dexterous interfaces and interaction techniques. Taking advantage of AI multi-robot control strategies, these robots can team up and collaborate to fulfill complex tasks in a robust and unprecedented flexible way. By exploiting multisensory interaction techniques and cognitive shared control, the operator will achieve an unparalleled level of seamless interaction and continuous collaboration with the robotic team. According to the application at hand, the robotic team will feature different task-specific characteristics (e.g., biocompatibility for medical procedures, biodenitrification for cleaning water, ability to carry drugs to fight infections) and be dispatched through various delivery systems, including a stimuli-responsive milli-scale wireless robotic carrier developed within the project. To achieve this revolution, REGO will develop magnetic multi-robot motion control systems, autonomous swarm control techniques for micro-sized robots, human-robot haptic-centered interfaces, and cognitive shared-control techniques. REGO enables the next generation of AI-powered interactive small-size multi-robots systems, with increased capabilities to work with each other and their human operators.	human-robot interaction, multi-robot systems, microrobotics, haptics	CENTRE NATIONAL DE LA RECHERCHE SCIENTIFIQUE CNRS	UNIVERSITEIT TWENTE, CENTRE HOSPITALIER UNIVERSITAIRE DE RENNES, SCUOLA SUPERIORE DI STUDI UNIVERSITARI E DI PERFEZIONAMENTO S ANNA, FONDAZIONE ISTITUTO ITALIANO DI TECNOLOGIA, HAPTION SA, HELMHOLTZ-ZENTRUM DRESDEN-ROSSENDORF EV	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101070066/program/43108390/details	
Biointelligent Production Sensor to Measure Viral Activity (BioProS)	We aim to transform virus biomanufacturing processes and enable new quality control strategies by a continuous, real-time capable biohybrid sensor technology to detect cell-based virus infection cycles. BioProS sensor concept makes use of an optical sensor technology in combination with cell-based measurement principles. In this context a platform technology will be developed that can be adapted to multiple specific analytes which enables its applicability in different industries and production settings. The development of such platform technology together with its technological complexity requires the involvement of multiple stakeholders throughout Europe and across disciplines (biology, engineering science, data science, manufacturing experts). Digitalisation has to extend from the very beginning of the process into the whole manufacturing chain, utilising all advances achieved in smart and lot-size-one manufacturing in recent years. This leads to the closely intertwined interaction of technical, informational and biological systems also referred to as bio-intelligent systems. This new paradigm opens up a large new space for innovations, recognised as a strategic field in America, Asia and Europe. Based on the manufacturing excellence leadership of Europe, BioProS will significantly contribute to all expected impacts of the Destination “Digital and Emerging Technologies” and explicitly to each of the four expected outcomes of this call topic. The consortium aims to gather all required expertise and set the basis for international partnerships. In close cooperation with pan-European initiatives and with the support of an industry advisory board, project partners aim to transform the vision of bio-intelligent manufacturing and demonstrate the applicability of disruptive technologies in an industrial setting. We will promote the research community for bio-intelligent methods and applications worldwide, and at the same time create technology sovereignty for Europe.	bio-intelligent, biomanufacturing, decentralized production, viral vector production, process control, bioprinting, in-line monitoring, digital sensor, sustainability, cell and gene therapy	FRAUNHOFER GESELLSCHAFT ZUR FORDERUNG DER ANGEWANDTEN FORSCHUNG EV	EBERHARD KARLS UNIVERSITAET TUEBINGEN, POLITECNICO DI MILANO, BICO GROUP AB, ELVESYS, NETHERLANDS CENTER FOR THE CLINICAL ADVANCEMENT OF STEM CELL & GENE THERAPIES BV, EURA AG	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101070120/program/43108390/details	
SUstainable self-charging power systems developed by INKjet printing (SUINK)	Industry demands to reduce the weight of components in order to increase productivity and energy efficiency have led to the development of embedded functional electronics solutions to reduce the weight and volume of smart products. The Sustainable Development Goals balance the three dimensions of sustainable development (economic, social and environmental). SUINK will focus its developments on meeting sustainability indicators along the entire value chain (design, manufacturing, use and end-of-life) The main objective of SUINK is to design and implement sustainable, flexible and printable self-charging power systems (SCPS) able to supply power to a wide range of sensors. This SCPS will be formed by sustainable elements: 1) a piezoelectric energy generator to harvest electrical energy from mechanical vibrations based on pìezoelectric PLA, 2) a rectifying system as a connection circuit with 3) a fully printed biobased supercapacitor as energy storage component. The overall solution will be based on the proper combination of biobased conductive, dielectric and piezoelectric inks that will be applied by inkjet printing, a high throughput and easy-to-implement process, on biobased flexible substrates. The printed substrates will be implemented in the following elements: 1) a PLA seat (temperature sensor), 2) a PLA bracket located inside the car, specifically in the windscreen of the car (temperature/humidity sensor) and 3) a thermoset composite (strain sensor). The foils will be used for the creation of in-mold structural electronics through a) plastic injection over moulding; b) one-shot hybrid textile and c) autoclave/sheet moulding processes, towards the development of multifunctional components meeting the requirements of the automotive.

Socially-acceptable Extended Reality Models and Systems (SERMAS)	The revolutionary opportunities opened by eXtended Reality (XR) technologies will only materialize if concepts, techniques, and tools are provisioned to ensure the social acceptance of XR systems. For that, we need XR systems that are not just innovative and functionally complex, but also provide an experience that: satisfies the goals and needs of the user, is in compliance with the social context in which the system is being used, and is transparent, safe, secure, explainable and is trusted by the user. However, current generations of XR systems fail to provide the XR experience they were envisioned for since state-of-the-art models and technologies of XR systems fail to ensure full-fledged social acceptance. A truly XR experience requires a major paradigm shift in the way XR systems are designed, implemented, deployed and consumed. The SERMAS project will develop innovative, formal and systematic methodologies and technologies to model, develop, analyze, test and user-study socially-acceptable XR systems. This will be achieved by pursuing the following four main objectives: 1. Follow an inter-disciplinary, multi-sectorial, case-study-driven, scientific and technological methodology to implement the SERMAS Toolkit, a set of methods and tools that will greatly simplify the design, development, deployment, and management of socially-acceptable XR systems. 2. Apply the Toolkit to industrial case studies drawn from real-world application scenarios, thus paving the way to transferring project results to industrial practice. This will be possible through the active participation in the consortium of the developers of mass-use industrial XR applications. 3. Enable innovators to leverage the Toolkit to improve the social acceptance and cut down the time-to-market of their XR systems, thereby enhancing the competitiveness of the vendors. 4. Produce the wider SERMAS Methodology to position the use of the Toolkit and enlarge its outreach.

Emergent awareness from minimal collectives (EMERGE)	Awareness in biological agents has converging definitions when considering local states describing content-related consciousness from an agent-specific perspective. However, it becomes highly debated when it comes to global states. The issue magnifies when considering collectives of artificial agents. Several frameworks exist, all unsatisfactory in the limitations posed to agents’ heterogeneity and disappearance of the local self into an integrated state. Ultimately, existing frameworks are ineffective in explaining, facilitating, and supporting cooperative behaviours in artificial agents. The lack of a compelling theory of global awareness in AI is currently a significant barrier to the effective deployment of artificial agents in the real world. EMERGE tackles this grand challenge by introducing the novel concept of collaborative awareness for collectives of minimal artificial beings. We will investigate how simple agents can develop a representation of their mutual existence, environment, and cooperative behaviour towards the realization of tasks and goals. EMERGE builds on a scenario of artificial beings with no shared language and constrained individual capabilities, which nevertheless leads to high-complexity behaviours at the collective level. Collaborative awareness becomes an emergent process supporting complex, distributed, and loosely coupled systems capable of high degrees of collaboration, self-regulation, and interoperability without pre-defined protocols. EMERGE delivers a philosophical, mathematical, and technological framework that enables us to know how and where to allocate awareness to achieve a goal through the collective optimally. We will demonstrate EMERGE concepts on robotic use cases, with hints of broader applicability of the framework to Internet of Things, pervasive computing, nanotechnologies. We will also investigate the ethical implications of collaborative awareness, focusing on moral responsibility, vulnerabilities, and trust.

GRAphene PHotonic frequency miXer (GRAPH-X)	Graph-X aims at the development of a novel hardware platform based on graphene photonic integrated circuits for ultra-high speed and scalable sub-THz D- (110-170 GHz) and H-band (170-240 GHz) wireless links. The proposed technology will be the basic building block for high-speed radio back haul links, multi beam forming antennas for massive MIMO, short distance high resolution RADAR sensing. GraPh-X targets the distribution and detection of multi Gbit/s radio signals over sub-THz tunable carrier frequencies. The main outcome of GraPh-X will be a monolithic electronic and photonic chip (EPIC) that will constitute the basic building block of a completely new class of photonic/electronic antenna arrays for the next generation sub-THz communication and RADAR systems. The proposed approach will allow to overcome the technical bottlenecks of current sub-THz technology, such as increasing detrimental effect of phase noise at higher carrier frequencies, and carrier frequency stability. To reach the goal, the wafer scale graphene photonic technology is needed and must go beyond the state of the art. A new technique (HMG-Stack technology) will be developed to allow multi-stacking of graphene layers maintaining the same properties of single layer graphene. The key component of GraPh-X is a novel optoelectronic efficient frequency mixer able to mix two optical wavelengths and a high data rate electrical signal. The photonic chip will be realized using a SiN photonic platform that will integrate HMG-Stack as active material. The monolithic integration of the graphene photonic mixer with SiGe BiCMOS electronics for mmWave amplification will enable high output power and reduced footprint (<500x500µm2), matching the requirements of a single element of mmWave antenna array system.

Wafer-scale platform for Photonic Programmable Multipurpose Integrated Circuits (PHORMIC)	PHORMIC establishes a European platform for next-generation programmable photonic chips with a low adoption threshold for product developers in diverse application domains. The PHORMIC platform consists of three tiers. The first tier is a 200 mm wafer-scale fabrication flow that augments an established world-class silicon photonics platform with transfer-printed III-V optical amplifiers and compact low-power MEMS actuators. The devices are encapsulated in wafer-scale hermetically sealed cavities that will also be used for on-chip gas cells to calibrate the tunable lasers built in PHORMIC. The combination of high-speed silicon photonics, broadband optical gain and low-power MEMS tuners is a true enabler for new applications. The process flow will be supported by a design kit for building complex photonic circuits. The second tier supplements the photonic chips with modular packaging processes and driver electronics (including high-speed drivers), and the packaging and connectivity logic are integrated in the design kit. This provides a low-threshold entry point for building complex photonic chip-based systems with active control and programmability. The third tier builds on this to create a multipurpose programmable photonic processor, which can control the flow of light in an analogue way through a software interface. This chip, together with its electronics and programming framework, forms a true “photonics development kit”. This enables an off-the-shelf use model like that of electronic FPGAs, reducing prototyping time for new concepts from >1 year to weeks. The PHORMIC consortium has all expertise to establish a full supply chain, including a migration path to a European industrial 200 mm foundry. The application potential of the three tiers of the platform is validated through three demonstrators, in datacenter communication, sensing and mm-wave wireless beamforming. For each case, a custom-designed chip will be compared to the multipurpose photonic processor.	silicon photonics, MEMS, lasers, programmable photonics, wafer-scale	INTERUNIVERSITAIR MICRO-ELECTRONICA CENTRUM	KUNGLIGA TEKNISKA HOEGSKOLAN, UNIVERSITY COLLEGE CORK, ASM AMICRA MICROTECHNOLOGIES GMBH, III-V LAB, MELLANOX TECHNOLOGIES LTD, SENTEA, VLC PHOTONICS SL, X-FAB MEMS FOUNDRY GmbH	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101070332/program/43108390/details	
European Lighthouse on Secure and Safe AI (ELSA)	In order to reinforce European leadership in safe and secure AI technology, we are proposing a virtual center of excellence on safe and secure AI that will address major challenges hampering the deployment of AI technology. These grand challenges are fundamental in nature. Addressing them in a sustainable manner requires a lighthouse rooted in scientific excellence and rigorous methods. We will develop a strategic research agenda which is supported by research programmes that focus on “technical robustness and safety”, “privacy preserving techniques and infrastructures” and “human agency and oversight”. Furthermore, we focus our efforts to detect, prevent and mitigate threats and enable recovery from harm by 3 grand challenges: “Robustness guarantees and certification”, “Private and robust collaborative learning at scale” and “Human-in-the-loop decision making: Integrated governance to ensure meaningful oversight” that cut across 6 use cases: health, autonomous driving, robotics, cybersecurity, multi-media, and document intelligence. Throughout our project, we seek to integrate robust technical approaches with legal and ethical principles supported by meaningful and effective governance architectures to nurture and sustain the development and deployment of AI technology that serves and promotes foundational European values. Our initiative builds on and expands the internationally recognized, highly successful and fully operational network of excellence ELLIS (European Laboratory for Learning and Intelligent Systems). We build ELSA on its 3 pillars: research programmes, a set of research units, and a PhD/postdoc programme, thereby connecting a network of over 100 organizations and more than 337 ELLIS fellows and scholars (113 ERC grants) committed to shared standards of excellence. We will not only establish a virtual center of excellence, but all our activities will be also inclusive and open to input, interactions and collaboration of AI researchers and industrial partners in order to drive the entire field forward.

Carbon Neutral European Battery Cell Production with Sustainable, Innovative Processes and 3D Electrode Design to Manufacture (BatWoMan)	BatWoMan develops new sustainable and cost-efficient Li-ion battery cell production concepts, paving the way towards carbon neutral cell production within the European Union. This is realized via the following technological efforts: 1) energy-efficient, no volatile organic compounds (VOCs) processed electrodes, with slurries of high dry mass content; 2) innovative dry room reducing concept with improved electrolyte filling; 3) low-cost and energy-efficient cell conditioning, namely wetting, formation and ageing. The above stated technological improvements will be supported digitally via creating an AI-driven, innovative platform for smart re-tooling, constantly monitoring the sustainability and efficiency of the proposed individual production steps and developing a battery data space providing relevant cell background data. This way, BatWoMan will lead to estimated cell production cost reduction of 63.5% and cell production energy consumption reduction by 52.6% and therefore enable a European leadership position in sustainable battery production.

Dual circuit flow battery for hydrogen and value added chemical production (DualFlow)	DualFlow develops a radically new energy conversion and storage concept that combines water electrolysis, battery storage and co-production of decarbonized chemicals into one single hybrid technology using water soluble redox mediators as energy transfer vectors. The system can be operated for electricity storage or for energy conversion to hydrogen and value added chemicals. During energy storage operation, the system works as a conventional stationary flow battery. The energy conversion starts when the battery is full but there is abundant inexpensive green electricity available. Now the battery is chemically discharged in a mediated electrolysis to produce hydrogen and value added chemicals. The energy conversion is realized by pumping charged battery electrolytes through reactors. For hydrogen production, reactor is filled with catalytic particles to catalyze electron transfer and hydrogen evolution. For value added chemical production the reactor consists of biphasic system where charged electrolyte oxidizes chemicals in an organic phase. The reaction products are then extracted into the organic phase. The energy conversion operation requires only reactors and catalyst for hydrogen evolution, indicating that the additive costs of the dual circuit is minimal. The concept results in flexible system capable of both energy storage and energy conversion to hydrogen. We strongly believe that this concept offers possibilities to produce inexpensive hydrogen, in a flexible manner without utilizing any critical raw materials.	flow battery, mediated electrolysis, electrosynthesis	TURUN YLIOPISTO	AARHUS UNIVERSITET, UNIVERSITY OF LIMERICK, AALTO KORKEAKOULUSAATIO SR, ADVANCED SURFACE PLATING APS, NORDIC BIOPRODUCTS GROUP OY	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101070788/program/43108390/details	
TRUstworthy Multi-site Privacy Enhancing Technologies (TRUMPET)	In recent years, Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a revolutionary privacy-enhancing technology and, consequently, has quickly expanded to other applications. However, further research has cast a shadow of doubt on the strength of privacy protection provided by FL. Potential vulnerabilities and threats pointed out by researchers included a curious aggregator threat; susceptibility to man-in-the-middle and insider attacks that disrupt the convergence of global and local models or cause convergence to fake minima; and, most importantly, inference attacks that aim to re-identify data subjects from FL’s AI model parameter updates. The goal of TRUMPET is to research and develop novel privacy enhancement methods for Federated Learning, and to deliver a highly scalable Federated AI service platform for researchers, that will enable AI-powered studies of siloed, multi-site, cross-domain, cross border European datasets with privacy guarantees that exceed the requirements of GDPR. The generic TRUMPET platform will be piloted, demonstrated and validated in the specific use case of European cancer hospitals, allowing researchers and policymakers to extract AI-driven insights from previously inaccessible cross-border, cross-organization cancer data, while ensuring the patients’ privacy. The strong privacy protection accorded by the platform will be verified through the engagement of external experts for independent privacy leakage and re-identification testing. A secondary goal is to research, develop and promote with EU data protection authorities a novel metric and tool for the certification of GDPR compliance of FL implementations. The consortium is composed of 9 interdisciplinary partners: 3 Research Organizations, 1 University, 3 SMEs and 2 Clinical partners with extensive experience and expertise to guarantee the correct performance of the activities and the achievement of the results.

Morphing Computerized mats with Embodied Sensing and Artificial Intelligence (MOZART)	The MOZART project aims to advance the state-of-the art in robotic handling and manipulation of soft and heterogenous objects. The approach we take is a radical departure from existing manipulator approaches as we will develop a new concept for manipulation through the use of deformable manipulation surfaces supported by AI-powered control and learning tools. The manipulation surface is able to change its curvature locally and through this manipulates objects on the surface. The manipulation surface has three constituent elements. A conventional modular electronics layer responsible for communication, power, and computation, an actuation layer based on origami mechanisms, and finally, a soft poro-elastic sensing skin. The hardware development is complemented by a distributed control application programming interface which is built on cellular automata and deep learning. The framework includes basic and coordination primitives that allow for manipulation of individual objects and groups of objects, respectively. For demonstration we have chosen three target demonstrators in the food handling industry which are descaling fish, sorting of chicken and presentation of chicken. The final pillar of the project is an integrative-interdisciplinary social sciences and humanities approach that tackles the transition of the role of the operators today to more high-skilled jobs in the future. It also addresses the general ethical challenges surrounding food production to ensure sustainable technology development in terms of social and ethical as well as ecological consequences. The core research is complemented by a comprehensive dissemination and communication package that targets all relevant stakeholders. Finally, a clear exploitation plan including standardisation is described which will transition the AUTOMATs from TRL 5 at the end of the project to a product ready to impact the food packing industry four year after the end of the project.	origami robotics	IT-UNIVERSITETET I KOBENHAVN	FONDAZIONE ISTITUTO ITALIANO DI TECNOLOGIA, THE PROVOST, FELLOWS, FOUNDATION SCHOLARS & THE OTHER MEMBERS OF BOARD, OF THE COLLEGE OF THE HOLY & UNDIVIDED TRINITY OF QUEEN ELIZABETH NEAR DUBLIN, CABINPLANT A/S, UNI, FONDAZIONE ICONS, ASSOCIATION DE L'AVICULTURE, DE L'INDUSTRIE ET DU COMMERCE DE VOLAILLES DANS LES PAYS DE L'UNION EUROPEENNE	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101069536/program/43108390/details	
Application Aware, Life-Cycle Oriented Model-Hardware Co-Design Framework for Sustainable, Energy Efficient ML Systems (SustainML)	AI is increasingly becoming a significant factor in the CO2 footprint of the European economy. To avoid a conflict between sustainability and economic competitiveness and to allow the European economy to leverage AI for its leadership in a climate friendly way, new technologies to reduce the energy requirements of all parts of AI system are needed. A key problem is the fact that tools (e.g. PyTorch) and methods that currently drive the rapid spread and democratization of AI prioritize performance and functionality while paying little attention to the CO2 footprint. As a consequence, we see rapid growth in AI applications, but not much so in AI applications that are optimized for low power and sustainability. To change that we aim to develop an interactive design framework and associated models, methods and tools that will foster energy efficiency throughout the whole life-cycle of ML applications: from the design and exploration phase that includes exploratory iterations of training, testing and optimizing different system versions through the final training of the production systems (which often involves huge amounts of data, computation and epochs) and (where appropriate) continuous online re-training during deployment for the inference process. The framework will optimize the ML solutions based on the application tasks, across levels from hardware to model architecture. AI developers from all experience levels will be able to make use of the framework through its emphasis on human-centric interactive transparent design and functional knowledge cores, instead of the common blackbox and fully automated optimization approaches in AutoML. The framework will be made available on the AI4EU platform and disseminated through close collaboration with initiatives such as the ICT 48 networks. It will also be directly exploited by the industrial partners representing various parts of the relevant value chain: from software framework, through hardware to AI services.

Holistic and adaptivE Interface Design for human-technology Interactions (HEIDI)	Common adaptive vehicle HMIs implemented in today’s cars have limited sensing and predictive capabilities. Because of this, the risk is high to present information that is unsuitable for the current situation, which results in low usability and increased risk of distracting the driver. Furthermore, the exchange of information between driver and other road users is currently limited which often results in uncertain and unsafe situations. Driving automation only exacerbates the above-mentioned problem. External HMIs are one attempt to address this. The HEIDI project aims to develop a fluid, cooperative HMI that integrates internal and external adaptive HMI solutions in a holistic manner. This cooperative HMI effectively synchronises driver data and data from other road users to facilitate an optimal joint action between the actors, following the foresight safety1 concept. With this, the HEIDI HMI solutions guarantee that all road users share the same understanding of the situation with a view to ensuring a safe interaction. To realise this overall aim several technical innovation modules will be developed. These new HMI solutions will be prototyped and validated in a multi-user simulation environment and in real vehicle prototypes. For this purpose, the HEIDI project brings together key industry and academic partners that provide a unique infrastructure for developing, testing, and validating the proposed HMI concepts, such as the co-simulation environment provided by VTI, where pedestrians and drivers can interact in the same experiment in two interconnected simulators, and the facilities provided by RUAS, where real vehicles can interact with real pedestrians in a safe environment. Additionally, the HEIDI project will develop recommendations for regulation and standardisation guidelines to EuroNCAP and to IEEE, especially focusing on external HMIs, as this area is still characterised by high uncertainty for manufacturers.	fluid & cooperative HMI, road safety, advanced sensing	VIRTUAL VEHICLE RESEARCH GMBH	BAYERISCHE MOTOREN WERKE AKTIENGESELLSCHAFT, HOCHSCHULE REUTLINGEN, Honda Research Institute Europe GmbH, MARELLI EUROPE SPA, STATENS VAG- OCH TRANSPORTFORSKNINGSINSTITUT, UNIVERSIDAD DE ALCALA, TREE TECHNOLOGY SA, NISYS GMBH, MARELLI AUTOMOTIVE LIGHTING REUTLINGEN (GERMANY) GMBH	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101069538/program/43108390/details	
Symbolic logic framework for situational awareness in mixed autonomy (SymAware)	"SymAware addresses the fundamental need for a new conceptual framework for awareness in multi-agent systems (MASs) that is compatible with the internal models and specifications of robotic agents and that enables safe simultaneous operation of collaborating autonomous agents and humans. The goal of SymAware is to provide a comprehensive framework for situational awareness to support sustainable autonomy via agents that actively perceive risks and collaborate with other robots and humans to improve their awareness and understanding, while fulfilling complex and dynamically changing tasks. The SymAware framework will use compositional logic, symbolic computations, formal reasoning, and uncertainty quantification to characterise and support situational awareness of MAS in its various dimensions, sustaining awareness by learning in social contexts, quantifying risks based on limited knowledge, and formulating risk-aware negotiation of task distributions. These objectives will be achieved in SymAware through (a) logical characterisation of awareness using symbolic methods, (b) quantifying the symbolic reasoning for awareness with spatial and temporal ingredients for decision making, (c) risk awareness via quantified knowledge, (d) quantifying and communicating knowledge awareness, (e) demonstrating awareness engineering in aviation and automotive use cases, and (f) identifying requirements for ethical and trustworthy awareness in human-agent interaction. The objectives of SymAware address the ""Awareness Inside"" Challenge of EIC by extending and formalising human-based models of situational awareness and by providing a novel conceptual situational awareness framework for MASs that encompasses logical characterisation and integrative formal reasoning of interdependent awareness dimensions including knowledge, spatiotemporal, risk and social dimensions. This will support transitioning to safe mixed operation of autonomous agents and humans."

Living Therapeutic and Regenerative Materials with Specialised Advanced Layers (NextSkins)	Skin is a living interface with layers of specialised functions (sensing, regeneration, protection). The level of complexity in skins is currently unreached in engineered living materials (ELMs). Here we will create skin-inspired ELMs with layers with living cells, specialised properties and functions. Our living skins are based on a grown matrix hosting engineered multicellular consortia that build and functionalise different layers. Spatiotemporal patterning is realised by genetic control and the physicochemical properties of cells and biomolecules. Our aim is to generate platform technologies to advance biological ELMs and make two proof-of-concept engineered living skins with different applications: We will fabricate a self-encapsulated Living Therapeutic Skin (LTS) made of a bacterial cellulose hydrogel matrix with sense-and-respond cells. LTS will have an interactive layer with sensing functions, a core layer for responsive living cells, and a barrier layer for biocontainment and hydration. An example LTS will be designed to sense pathogenic skin bacteria in eczema and release biosynthesised therapeutic molecules. A dry and tough Living Regenerative Skin (LRS) consisting of biomineralized biopolymers hosting bacterial spores will be fabricated as an alternative to traditional inert materials (ceramics, plastics) in protective garments. The LRS biomineralized core will arrange in microscale layers, like tough biominerals in nature (nacre, bone, dentin). LRS will be encapsulated in an activator shell, engineered to prevent water penetration and to memorize local mechanical experience, giving local self-reinforcement of mechanically stressed regions, a unique property compared to current materials and other ELMs. As a powerful strategy to accelerate the adoption of our living materials in society, we will systematically involve the potential end-users and designers in our research for the materials and product development to happen in synergy.	engineered living materials, adaptive materials, genetic engineering, protein materials, bacterial cellulose, composite, self-assembly, encapsulation, biomineralization, material-driven design	TECHNISCHE UNIVERSITEIT DELFT	AALTO KORKEAKOULUSAATIO SR	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101071159/program/43108390/details	
Smart manufacturing for autologous cell therapies enabled by innovative biomonitoring technologies and advanced process control (SMARTER)	Autologous immunotherapies have revolutionised cancer treatment providing impressive survival benefits in patients with blood cancers. The next generation of personalised immunotherapies using tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) aims to overcome efficacy limitations of CAR-T therapies in the treatment of solid tumours. Lack of effective, fast, adaptive, controllable and scalable manufacturing process remains one of the critical bottlenecks for clinical adoption of such complex personalised cell therapies. In the SMARTER project, Achilles Therapeutics UK Limited, a clinical-stage company developing autologous cell therapies, partners with the centre of excellence for Cell and Gene Therapy Catapult and academic experts in process biomarker discovery (Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria La Fe) and bioprocess sensor development (Leibniz Universitat Hannover). The consortium aims to develop a first-in-class, smart bioprocessing manufacturing platform for personalised autologous cell therapies, implementing for the first time in-line process analytical technologies and smart process control systems. The project exploits breakthrough discoveries of novel T cell expansion process biomarkers and development of new fluorescence spectroscopy sensors for real-time monitoring of critical process parameters, toa enable adaptive process control of the precision TIL biomanufacturing process. After the project, the prototype R&D platform will be ready for follow-up development of the commercial scale bioreactor in GMP environment. The SMARTER platform will critically improve production efficiency, reduce overall costs-of-goods, shorten manufacturing cycle times (shorter vein-to-vein time), decrease batch failures and lead to more consistent and predictable cell therapy product quality. Finally, the innovations will enable clinical implementation of a potential breakthrough personalised adoptive cell therapy for hardest-to-treat solid tumours such as lung cancer and melanoma.	bioprocessing, manufacturing, immunotherapy, automation, immunotherapy, sensors, metabolomics	GOTTFRIED WILHELM LEIBNIZ UNIVERSITAET HANNOVER	FUNDACION PARA LA INVESTIGACION DEL HOSPITAL UNIVERSITARIO LA FE DE LA COMUNIDAD VALENCIANA	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101071054/program/43108390/details	
Computation driven development of novel vivo-like-DNA-nanotransducers for biomolecules structure identification (iSenseDNA)	The link between the structural change of a molecule and its function is of fundamental importance since it provides direct insight on mechanism of complex biological processes. Recent years have witnessed noticeable advances of analysis of complex molecular conformations, however the understanding of their conformational dynamics remain a formidable challenge and revolutionary advances are still demanded the analysis of chemical composition and structure of biomolecules, however the understanding of their conformational dynamics remains a formidable challenge, and revolutionary advances are still demanded. Molecular machines, such as the DNA itself, which work at the core of many cellular activities, is able to DNA modify its conformation and to transduce the signal upon binding to specific proteins. In this project, we will develop a DNA-nanotrasducer for real-time detection of conformational changes and the analysis of molecular dynamics as it occurs in-vivo biological processes. The project aims to provide: (i) the development of DNA-nanotransducers that can perform both detection and conformational analysis of molecular dynamics in one functional unit (ii), Use bioinformatics approaches to predict 3D structure of conformational states modelling real time evolution of interacting DNA-NT and proteins, and machine learning (ML) models to directly link the atomistic structure, conformational state, and dynamics (iii) Assess protein-DNA-NT binding by experimental approaches using linear and “on-chip” non-linear spectroscopies for the detection of vibrational signatures of organic molecular systems, to recognize consequent structural changes in the optical signal in real-time, (iv) Describe DNA-NT/protein interactions at the cellular level and 3D analysis of DNA-NT and model proteins, towards drug discovery. These research efforts will provide a foundation for a next generation of DNA-nanotransducers to be used for high-throughput functional molecular structure.

Up-Skilling for Industry 5.0 Roll-Out (Up-Skill)	The 4th Industrial Revolution/Industry 4.0 has enabled reduction of production costs, improved consistency of product quality and enabled mass customisation by merging the physical and digital worlds. The transition is still ongoing - Industry 4.0 is a general-purpose technology, adding value across all industrial sectors. However, the perception of Industry 4.0 at a human level has not all been positive. It has been plagued by fear of job cuts and in some sectors completely replacing the human workforce. Automation projects have often failed due to omitting the critical skilled human elements in business success with unintended consequences including reduced customer satisfaction, poorer product quality and lower process efficiency. Automation alone clearly cannot be a source of sustained competitive advantage. I5.0 will address the balance between humans and technology, focussing on the collaborative relationship between skilled workers and automation. The intent is reinstate skilled craftsmanship at the centre of production processes where people add unique value and competitive advantage, augmented by intelligent, data-driven technology emerging from Industry 4.0. In the Up-Skill project, we will address the implications of Industry 5.0, in particular the relationship between automation, skilled work and organisational systems. Our research will establish how the relationship between automation and human input plays out in a range of industrial settings, creating comparative case studies to capture effective implementation strategies. We will address under-explored strategic spaces in production - where automation adds value to skilled and artisanal work, and where further automation risks undermining product value. This research will identify the shifting organisational characteristics that are needed to ensure technology advancements are implemented within companies while ensuring sustainable, added value for man, machine, and organisation.

Electrocatalytic Production of liquid Organic hydrogen carrier and CHemicals from lignin (EPOCH)	EPOCH proposes to develop a novel approach in linking green hydrogen production with the direct loading of liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHC) enabling a transformative logistic of green hydrogen distribution and storage. Lignin derivatives are used to be selectively oxidized. Compared to water electrolysis, EPOCH will advance the field by (1) using the nascent hydrogen at the cathode directly to load LOHCs allowing economic H2 storage and transport, and (2) converting at the anode waste lignin and its derivatives via selective oxidation. EPOCH is beyond the state-of-the-art solutions, as it does not form molecular H2 at the cathode nor generates oxygen at the anode. By modifying both cathodic and anodic reactions, EPOCH reduces the energy intensity. EPOCH will enable better cell performance and enhanced added-value device operations by (i) improving energy efficiency, (ii) allowing cost reductions, and (iii) intensifying the process. The EPOCH device will be designed for flexible integration with biorefineries and pulp & paper industries, to valorize their lignin waste streams, thus, linking these industrial sectors and H2 economy. EPOCH will allow the production of green H2 in areas where renewable energy production (in the energy mix) is higher. Therefore, EPOCH will offer a new path to effectively decrease the carbon footprint of energy-intensive industries. Development of the novel EPOCH electrocatalytic device requires (a) advanced components (electrocatalysts, electrodes, electrolytes and ionic liquid promoters, membranes) and (b) validation of the full module cell operation at laboratory scale. Thus, our project integrates multidisciplinary top-experts in areas such as electrocatalysis, lignin chemistry, and materials synthesis, with a large engineering company on energy transition and a SME world-leading the LOHC technology development and logistic.

Ferroelectric PHOtonics ENablIng novel functionalities and enhanced performance of neXt generating PICs (PHOENIX)	In PHOENIX, we create the next generation of compact photonic integrated circuits (PIC) offering a continuous and efficient control over optical signals. A barium titanate (BTO) on silicon nitride (SiN) platform will be optimized to enable novel functionalities and produce enhanced PICs. The novel functionalities stem from a combination of materials having a metal-insulator transition with epitaxial ferroelectrics. Vanadium oxides (VOx) deliver a maximum contrast in absorption while Barium Titanate (BTO) offers an efficient and programmable control of the phase of an optical signal through Pockels and photorefractive effects. The developed technologies will be demonstrated in four uses cases in high-impact emerging applications: 1) fully homomorphic encryption, 2) 5G infrastructure, 3) inference of deep neural networks and 4) training of deep neural networks. The project has four main objectives: a) to provide novel photonic technologies with enhanced functionalities thanks to the integration of VOx and BTO, b) to provide a BTO/SiN waveguide platform for subsequent manufacturing of PICs and an upgraded version of such a platform integrating VOx with the potential to improve their performance and scalability, c) to build up the demonstrators, and d) to advance in the understanding, realization and upscaling of high-quality oxide thin-films by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) on large area. The validation of the developed technology will be completed with an extrapolation to benchmark against representative existing systems and a roadmap for photonic-electronic integration.

Unveiling Innovation Potential of Circular Approaches in Automotive Electronics and Beyond (UNICORN)	To strengthen EU’s global competitiveness and resilience, the updated Industrial Strategy calls for accelerating the green and digital transitions of key European ecosystems. UNICORN foresees functional electronics as an enabler & catalyser of EU mobility’s twin transition. Using a car-as-a lab, UNICORN is aiming at increasing the circularity-driven functional integration of electronics in automotive, while simultaneously embedding eco-design principles in their development and ensuring net beneficial effect on climate change mitigation. UNICORN will demonstrate a capability to design & develop innovative green and circular technologies for automotive electronics, based on four electronic systems (composite-embedded, in-molded, textile/plastic and rubber-integrated) taken from industrial use cases for a battery casing, a dashboard, a seat/door system and a tire. Solutions will 1) encompass lightweight, low impact and/or bio-based materials for (flexible) substrates, films, encapsulation, inks, solvents, adhesives and flat cabling & interconnects; 2) validate resource/energy efficient, net shape, additive, printing, encapsulating and (reversible) bonding manufacturing processes for circuitry, sensors, gauges, antennas, interconnects; and 3) implement design for material circularity via reversible design, modularity, form factors to increase disassembly and recovery of valuable material. For harnessing benefits of these technologies, UNICORN will set a new methodology for net impact assessment and eco-design guidelines for automotive electronics designers & developers. It will establish a vision and roadmap on the role of functional electronics for supporting EU mobility climate targets, and set the blueprints for transfers in further application sectors. UNICORN gathers 12 partners (7 companies) mutualising skills and pilot/industrial capacities on flexible, printed & organic electronics, circularity & regulatory competences and business leaderships in Automotive.

Ontology-based Decentralized Sharing of Industry Data in the European Circular Economy (Onto-DESIDE)	Circular economy aims at reducing value loss and avoiding waste, by circulating materials or product parts before they become waste. Today, lack of support for sharing data in a secure, quality assured, and automated way is one of the main obstacles that industry actors point to when creating new circular value networks. Together with using different terminologies and not having explicit definitions of the concepts that appear in data, this makes it very difficult to create new ecosystems of actors in Europe today. This project will address the core challenges of making decentralized data and information understandable and usable for humans as well as machines. The project will leverage open standards for semantic data interoperability in establishing a shared vocabulary (ontology network) for data documentation, as well as a decentralized digital platform that enables collaboration in a secure and privacy-preserving manner. The project addresses a number of open research problems, including the development of ontologies that need to model a wide range of different materials and products, not only providing vertical interoperability but also horizontal interoperability, for cross-industry value networks. As well as transdisciplinary research on methods to find, analyse and assess new circular value chain configurations opened up by considering resource, information, value and energy flows as an integral part of the same complex system. Three industry use cases, from radically different industry domains, act as drivers for the research and development activities, as well as test beds and demonstrators for the cross-industry applicability of the results. The developed solutions will allow for automation of planning, management, and execution of circular value networks, at a European scale, and beyond. The project thereby supports acceleration of the digital and green transitions, automating the discovery and formation of new collaborations in the circular economy.

Green and Sustainable Processes for Electrode Production (greenSPEED)	Lithium-ion technology is the means to greener and more sustainable mobility and other mobile applications, but the process of cell manufacturing is still energy consuming and using environmentally harmful substances. The greenSPEED project offers solutions for new sustainable electrode and cell manufacturing processes with reduced energy consumption, lower carbon footprint and ZERO Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) emissions. To that aim, the project main target is developing a battery cell comprised of electrodes manufactured by innovative dry processes. Our composite cathode, based on Ni-rich NMC, is to be manufactured by scalable roll-to-roll dry electrode coating process, that fully removes the use of casting-solvents and eliminates the need of energy-intense drying-, condensate and transportation process required in state-of-the-art electrode fabrication. The greenSPEED high-capacity pure-silicon anode is to be manufactured taking full advantage of our innovative process based on Microwave-Assisted Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition (MW-PECVD), which deposits porous silicon directly on the copper current-collector starting from locally produced silane gas (SiH4). Moreover, the use of advanced modelling and simulation techniques including digital twins, artificial intelligence, and machine learning are to be employed to predict and optimise cell performance in early development stages, support the cell production process by virtually assessing the influence and importance of production parameters and thus minimising the number of experiments and to accelerate electrode production optimisation steps. The greenSPEED cell aims at increasing energy density (+69%) while reducing energy consumption (-32%) and costs (-21%) of production as compared to state-of-the-art Li-ion cells. The concepts here proposed have been already demonstrated at TRL 2/3 with the aim of reaching TRL 5/6 by the end of the project.	battery, green process, sustainability, Artificial Intelligence, Digital Twin	VIRTUAL VEHICLE RESEARCH GMBH	AVL LIST GMBH, ZENTRUM FUR SONNENENERGIE- UND WASSERSTOFF-FORSCHUNG BADEN-WURTTEMBERG, CIRCUIT FOIL LUXEMBOURG, ARKEMA FRANCE SA, LEYDENJAR TECHNOLOGIES BV, BAYERISCHE MOTOREN WERKE AKTIENGESELLSCHAFT, VARTA INNOVATION GMBH, FORSCHUNGSZENTRUM JULICH GMBH, SPEIRA GMBH, UMICORE AG & CO KG	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101069528/program/43108390/details	
Intracranial Neuro Telemetry to Restore Communication (INTRECOM)	Not being able to communicate while still being conscious is a horrifying prospective for many patients worldwide. Patients with motor neuron disorders, trauma or stroke risk losing complete muscle control leading to Locked-In Syndrome (LIS) which leaves them completely paralysed and unable to communicate. This is an intolerable, fearful situation with very low quality of life and extreme burden of care for patients, family, and care givers. Intracranial Neuro Telemetry to REstore COMmunication (INTRECOM) will provide a breakthrough for these patients by developing a novel, fully implantable Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) technology that allows for real-time speech decoding and use in the home environment.

Opto-Electronic Neural Connectoid Model Implemented for Neurodegenerative Disease (OpenMIND)	A major challenge facing Europe is its ageing population and associated increase in diagnosed cases of neurodegenerative diseases (NDD). Parkinson’s disease (PD) is associated with tremor and loss of motor functions due to progressive degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the brain. This can lead to memory loss and dementia, which is associated with short- and long-term injuries and disabilities with emotional, financial, and social burdens for patients, families, and society. The exact causes and mechanisms underlying PD are still unknown and existing treatments focus on alleviating symptoms and increasing quality of life, but do not halt or reverse disease progression. Although animal models give unique possibilities to study physiological and behavioural mechanisms, drug development fails due to lack of translation to humans. Alternative non-animal NDD models is needed both in terms of better translation, but also to replace expensive and problematic animal experiments. We will move disease modelling to a new level and replace animal models, by creating a new concept we call connectoids. We will develop an ex-vivo-type in vitro human opto-electronic multi-regional brain-organoid disease model in which connectoids are formed by precise spatial arrangement of brain organoids connected via hydrogel tracts that promote axonal pathfinding, functional connection, and signalling. By developing 1) light controllable sub-type specific neurons within regionalized brain organoids, and 2) electrodes and waveguides that can penetrate the organoids able to monitor neurotransmitter signalling inside and between the organoids, we will for the first time be able to sense how a particular brain region responds to a certain therapy and watch in real time how signals are transmitted to other brain regions. Our model will not only have health benefit, but will relieve a heavy economic burden on society, and open up for new possibilities for technological and economic development.

Transforming brain surgery by advancing functional-guided neuronavigational imaging (HyperProbe)	In recent years, through the advancement of imaging technologies (such as MRI, PET, CT, among others) clinical localisation of lesions of the central nervous system (CNS) pre-surgery has made possible for neurosurgeons to plan and navigate away from functional brain locations when removing tumours. However, neuronavigation in the surgical management of brain tumours remains a significant challenge, due to the inability to maintain accurate spatial information of lesioned and non-lesioned locations intraoperatively. To answer this challenge, we have put together a team of engineers, physicists, data scientists and neurosurgeons to develop an innovative, all-optical intraoperative imaging system based on (i) hyperspectral imaging (HSI) for rapid, multi wavelength spectral acquisition, and (ii) artificial intelligence (AI) for image reconstruction and molecular fingerprint recognition. Our intraoperative HSI system (HyperProbe) will (1) map, monitor and quantify biomolecules of interest; (2) be handheld and user-friendly; (3) apply AI-based methods for the reconstruction of spectral images, the analysis of spatio-spectral data and the development and quantification of novel biomarkers. We will validate the developed capacity in phantoms, in vivo against gold standard modalities in neuronavigational imaging, and finally provide proof-of principle during brain tumour surgery. HyperProbe aims at providing functional and structural information on biomarkers of interest that is currently missing during neuro-oncological interventions.

FINE-TUNING T CELL NETWORKS OF EXHAUSTION BY SYNTHETIC SENSORS (T-FITNESS)	Cell and gene therapies offer a massive paradigm shift from current treatment options and hold the potential to cure previously untreatable diseases. Naturally-occurring and genetically modified T cells with chimeric antigen (CAR) or T cell receptors (TCR) have demonstrated remarkable curative capacities against advanced hematologic malignancies but have shown limited efficacy in treating solid tumors. Major barriers hindering the full antitumor potential of T cells are the immunosuppressive signals and persisting antigenic stimuli within the tumor microenvironment that inexorably push T cells into a highly dysfunctional state called “exhaustion”. Herein, we propose a groundbreaking technology, T-FITNESS, which will enable antitumor T cells to become refractory to exhaustion. At the core of the platform are microRNA (miRNA)-based synthetic logic circuits capable of rewiring the transcriptional networks orchestrating T cell exhaustion. By harnessing the power of CRISPR/Cas genome editing, we will integrate sensors of miRNAs upregulated in exhausted cells into untranslated regions of one or more transcription factors driving T cell exhaustion, to enable their fine-tuned downregulation. We will validate the reprogramming efficacy of T-FITNESS by performing extensive functional analyses in vitro and in vivo and advance the best circuits towards the clinic by developing an automated cGMP-compliant manufacturing process for point-of-care production of T-FITNESS-edited CAR-T cells. To develop this innovative platform, we will bring together a multidisciplinary consortium of academic and industry partners that combine their unique expertise in T cell therapy and immunology, synthetic biology, genome editing, cGMP manufacturing, bioinformatics, and communication. Easily integrable within CAR-T, TCR-T, and tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) platforms, T-FITNESS will unleash the curative potential of T cell therapy for the benefit of an ever-growing number of cancer patients.

A metapredictive model of synthetic awareness for enabling tool invention (METATOOL)	Around 3.3 million years ago our ancestors made the first tool. They imagined a new utensil and then knapped a stone until it became an efficient tool for cutting. Tool creation was an outstanding technological milestone for humanity providing us with unprecedented control over our environment. This ability required cognitive capabilities, such as prediction, metacognition, abstraction, and creativity—all of which are associated in humans with awareness. Current artificial intelligence systems and robots largely lack these capabilities and cannot even monitor and evaluate the consequence of their actions let alone develop new tools to address environmental challenges. METATOOL aims to provide a computational model of synthetic awareness to enhance adaptation and achieve tool invention. This will enable a robot to monitor and self-evaluate its performance, ground and reuse this information for adapting to new circumstances, and finally unlock the possibility of creating new tools. Under the predictive account of awareness, and based on both neuroscientific and archeological evidence, we will: 1) develop a novel computational model of metacognition based on predictive processing (metaprediction) and 2) validate its utility in real robots in two use case scenarios: conditional sequential tasks and tool creation. METATOOL will provide a blueprint for the next generation of artificial systems and robots that can perform adaptive, and anticipative, control with and without tools (improved technology), self-evaluation (novel explainable AI), and invent new tools (disruptive innovation). Tool-making and tool-invention are outstanding technological milestones in human history. A similar breakthrough can now be envisioned in engineering. We already have algorithms to enable machines to use tools and now it is time to develop robots that create tools.

A holistic approach in patient management and epidemic surveillance through convergence of diagnostic technologies, capacity building and stakeholder engagement (HoliCare)	Research on Poverty-Related Diseases (PRDs) in sub-Saharan Africa suffers from major technological and non-technological challenges that prevent high quality healthcare to reach many areas. Not only their performance, but also the affordability, manufacturability, suitability for Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs) and deployment of the (few) available diagnostics are main barriers to ensure good quality of healthcare in sub-Saharan Africa. The HoliCare project aims to tackle such challenges from a holistic perspective, by bridging the gap between technological excellence, available infrastructures, capacity, and local uptake of new technologies. We have chosen to work with lower respiratory infections as a blueprint for our new approach due to their huge clinical and socioeconomic impact, and relevance to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Technology-wise, we propose a 2-tiered, digitally interfaced diagnostic approach that will start in the field using multiplexed lateral flow tests for rapid screening and triage, followed by a referral to a hospital (when needed) and a follow-up detailed diagnosis using a POC-Instrument performing simultaneous nucleic acid amplification (LAMP) for pathogen identification and immunoassays for host biomarker quantitation. Digital and manufacturing infrastructures will encompass these technology innovations to ensure future local product development. Quality controlled biobanks will be developed for executing reliable clinical studies. Training and human capital investment will be achieved by focussed and high-level training activities. Adoption and implementation activities will pave the way for the proposed diagnostic solutions to be successfully deployed, fitting the purpose of the local populations. Our developments will be scalable, adaptable and transferrable to other diseases and national (eco) systems, aiming to contribute to the improvement of healthcare delivery in sub-Saharan Africa.

Remote whole-brain functional microscopy of the vascular system: a paradigm shift for the monitoring and treatment of small vessel diseases (MICROVASC)	Obtaining functional information on living organs non-invasively across different size scales is a tremendous challenge in medical imaging research, as diseases start locally at the cellular level deep into organs before expressing large-scale and observable symptoms. The unique complexity of the human brain adds another level of difficulty for neuroimaging. The cerebrovascular system consists of a multiscale network of blood vessels. Interaction between neurons and this vascular system, the so-called neurovascular coupling, is a major foundation of brain function leading to constant adaptation of the local cerebral blood flow to local metabolic demand. Its alteration is intimately linked to cerebral dysfunction. Current brain imaging modalities are essential for evaluating cerebrovascular diseases in patients but are restricted to millimetric resolution and fail to capture most of blood flow dynamics. Here, we propose to revolutionize the field of neuroimaging by introducing a groundbreaking technology called functional Ultrasound Localization Microscopy (fULM) capable of monitoring transcranially the whole human brain vasculature and function down to microscopic resolution. Beyond opening a complete paradigm shift in brain angiography (at least two orders of magnitude increase in spatial resolution), fULM will also be able to map the functional brain response during task-evoked and spontaneous activity at microscopic levels. We will address major technical challenges of ultrasound imaging, develop advanced neurocomputational analysis methods, validate our methods in preclinical models of cerebrovascular diseases and perform a First-In-Human study. Fundamental understanding of brain hemodynamics and neurovascular coupling as well as early clinical diagnosis of neurovascular abnormalities and evaluation of drug efficacy would tremendously benefit from such capabilities revealing both the brain vasculature and neurofunctional activity down to microscopic resolutions.	functional ultrasound, ultrasound localization microscopy, small cerebral vessel diseases, brain microangiography, neurovascular coupling	INSTITUT NATIONAL DE LA SANTE ET DE LA RECHERCHE MEDICALE	ICONEUS, ACADEMISCH ZIEKENHUIS LEIDEN, AZIENDA SOCIO-SANITARIA TERRITORIALE (ASST) DI CREMA, STICHTING SINT ANTONIUS ZIEKENHUIS	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101070917/program/43108390/details	
Exploiting ex vivo expansion and deep multiomics profiling to bring novel, efficient and safer hematopoietic stem cell gene therapies to clinical application (X-PAND)	Hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) are an elusive cell type, whose presence can only be inferred retrospectively, from the outcome of time-consuming transplantation experiments. Since current state-of-the-art does not allow prospective HSC identification, today’s cell and gene therapy technology has been mostly optimized on surrogate progenitor cells, which differ biologically from HSC. The technological breakthrough of this proposal is to capture HSC in the ex vivo culture, achieved by a combination of innovative expansion conditions, iterative cell sorting and multiomics single cell profiling. Rapid, quantitative and qualitative in vitro HSC assessment predictive of in vivo function may become a sustainable alternative to mouse xenotransplantation experiments. Applied to a state-of-the-art toolbox of genetic engineering technologies including clinically-proven lentiviral vectors as well as established and emerging targeted genome editing approaches, our in vitro HSC readout sets new standards in terms of throughput and turnaround time, allowing to efficiently test a multitude of HSC engineering conditions and tailor the most suitable technological approach to a specific disease or therapeutic application. This new precision-based approach to ex vivo HSC gene therapy will be applied to inherited bone marrow failure syndromes and cancer as paradigmatic examples where gene therapy may be used to correct a cell-intrinsic genetic defect or turn hematopoietic progeny into therapeutic vehicles provided with novel functions. Bringing together experts in cutting-edge gene editing technologies, ex vivo HSC manipulation, assessment of HSC responses to genetic engineering and bioinformatics analysis & integration of multi-dimensional single cell data will maximize the chances of delivering safer and more effective next-generation HSC-based gene therapy products, extending the reach of gene therapy to new disease contexts and making the outcome after gene therapy more predictable.

Development and validation of a quantitative point-of-care test for the measurement of severity biomarkers to improve risk stratification of fever syndromes and enhance child survival (EChiLiBRiST)	"Fever is the leading reason to seek healthcare globally, with over 1 billion cases of febrile illness occurring in children annually. The vast majority of infections are uncomplicated and self-limited and can be treated conservatively. A few (<1%) are life-threatening but are often challenging to identify early in the course of illness. Our project challenges the current status quo and inefficiencies of triaging practices. We propose to develop and validate a rapid triaging tool to determine, objectively, quantitatively and with high precision those patients at risk of dying, so as to prioritize their care. The breakthrough solution lies in the ENDOTHELIUM, a newly recognized in vivo biosensor, which plays a critical role in our defense against pathogens. Endothelial cell activation and subsequent loss of integrity is a common pathway of injury in several life-threatening infections, including sepsis, malaria, or even COVID-19. Measuring specific mediators of this pathway (sTREM-1, Ang2, etc.) at first clinical presentation can reliably identify individuals at risk of dying, irrespective of the disease causing the fever, and more robustly than previously known predictors such as clinical algorithms or ""classic"" biomarkers. Importantly, these pathways are also ""druggable"", thus allowing the testing or re-purposing of specific interventions to improve outcome. We will design and produce a RTT (glucometer-like) that quantitatively measures the two markers with best predictive performance (sTREM-1 and Ang2). We will then incorporate it into 2 clinical trials (to be done in Mozambique, Gabon and Ethiopia) to 1) verify the improved performance of the proposed PoC RTT in risk-stratifying and predicting mortality among paediatric patients when compared to standard of care, and 2) test whether a specific intervention (nutritional supplementation of L-Citrulline), guided by biomarker results, improves (vs. placebo) long-term outcomes and survival after hospital discharge."

INtegrated Short-term PallIative REhabilitation to improve quality of life and equitable care access in incurable cancer (INSPIRE)	Disability related to incurable cancer affects over a million Europeans each year. Our objective is to test the clinical and cost effectiveness of an integrated short-term palliative rehabilitation intervention, to improve function and quality of life in people affected by incurable cancer. At the core of INSPIRE is a multinational randomised controlled trial across five European countries. We will recruit 340 participants to assess the clinical and cost-effectiveness of palliative rehabilitation on quality of life, disability, symptom burden and goal attainment in people with incurable cancer. If positive, the trial could result in a scalable and equitable intervention that improves function and quality of life in people with incurable cancer, and reduces the burden of care for their families. The intervention can be adapted and integrated into different health systems using existing staff and services, with little or no additional cost. To support our ambition to make palliative rehabilitation part of routine care for people with incurable cancer we also conduct: - comparative analysis of health services to understand current integration of rehabilitation across oncology and palliative care services; - mixed-method evaluations of equity and inclusivity, processes and implementation for the intervention, at patient, health service and health system levels; - evidence synthesis and a Delphi consensus on indicators, core interventions, outcomes, and integration methods, to develop a framework for palliative rehabilitation practice and policy. The INSPIRE consortium brings together leaders in palliative care, oncology and rehabilitation from Nordic, Southern and Northern European countries, with complementary expertise in health services research, trials of complex interventions, mixed method evaluations, statistics and economics. We are partnering with European civil society organisations to ensure citizen engagement and dissemination at the highest level.

4-Deep Brain Reconstruction (4-DBR)	The 4-Deep Brain Reconstruction, 4-DBR consortium aims at generating a brand-new technological approach to regenerate brain affections that occurs in neurological disorders. With 180 million affected people and an economic burden of 798 billion euros/year, Europe needs a radical leap in the future. The complexity of the human brain has condemned every past attempt at regeneration because incomplete technologies did not allow for a full recapitulation of the brain properties and any one of them missing jeopardized the functionality of the whole. There can't be any incremental solution for brain damage, the technology must be all-in. 4-DBR will focus on developing an implantable 4D reconstructed brain able to recapitulate all brain properties: a complex architecture of neuronal cells integrated in a complete blood circuitry, that will be complemented with an integrated opto-stimulator to induce correct specification and integration of neurons. 4-DBR integrates 6 technological leaders from complementary fields who will unite to develop the components of reconstructed-brains: laser-assisted bioprinting of pre-differentiated neurons with their native decellularized brain matrix, extrusion bioprinting of vascular system, in vitro blood-brain-barrier reconstruction and a tissue integrated wireless-controlled stimulating optoelectrical chip. These 4 components will then be combined into a transplantable reconstructed brain that will be tested in a small animal model of Huntington’s disease. While a first prototype will be delivered in 36 months, the vision unifying 4-DBR expands way further. Therefore, the project will put into action a strong dissemination and exploitation plan: horizontally, 4-DBR will ensure the uptake of the generated methods to strengthen Europe’s technological actors; vertically, 4-DBR will thrust the reconstructed brain approach up in the development ladder to potentially generate in a 10-year span a therapy to change the lives of many patients.	3D bioprinting, organoid transplantation, optoelectrical chip engineering	FUNDACIO DE RECERCA CLINIC BARCELONA-INSTITUT D INVESTIGACIONS BIOMEDIQUES AUGUST PI I SUNYER	POIETIS, VERIGRAFT AB, DANMARKS TEKNISKE UNIVERSITET, OSPEDALE SAN RAFFAELE SRL, UNIVERSITAT DE BARCELONA	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101047099/program/43108390/details	
AI-based CCAM: Trustworthy, Explainable, and Accountable (AIthena)	Connected and Cooperative Automotive Mobility (CCAM) solutions have emerged thanks to novel Artificial Intelligence (AI) which can be trained with huge amounts of data to produce driving functions with better-than-human performance under certain conditions. The race on AI keeps on building HW/SW frameworks to manage and process even larger real and synthetic datasets to train increasingly accurate AI models. However, AI remains largely unexplored with respect to explainability (interpretability of model functioning), privacy preservation (exposure of sensitive data), ethics (bias and wanted/unwanted behaviour), and accountability (responsibilities of AI outputs). These features will establish the basis of trustworthy AI, as a novel paradigm to fully understand and trust AI in operation, while using it at its full capabilities for the benefit of society. AITHENA will contribute to build Explainable AI (XAI) in CCAM development and testing frameworks, researching three main AI pillars: data (real/synthetic data management), models (data fusion, hybrid AI approaches), and testing (physical/virtual XiL set-ups with scalable MLOps). A human-centric methodology will be created to derive trustworthy AI dimensions from user identified group needs in CCAM applications. AITHENA will innovate proposing a set of Key Performance Indicators (KPI) on XAI, and an analysis to explore trade-offs between these dimensions. Demonstrators will show the AITHENA methodology in four critical use cases: perception (what does the AI perceive, and why), situational awareness (what is the AI understanding about the current driving environment, including the driver state), decision (why a certain decision is taken), and traffic management (how transport-level applications interoperate with AI-enabled systems operating at vehicle-level). Created data and tools will be made available via European data sharing initiatives (OpenData and OpenTools) to foster research on trustworthy AI for CCAM.

Vehicles and VRU Virtual eValuation of Road Safety (V4SAFETY)	In order to set policies for road safety in the coming decades and push for Vision Zero, an accepted and reliable method for the comparison of safety measures for CCAM is needed. The proposed method will deal with the safety of all road users, from vulnerable road users to vehicle occupants. V4Safety will provide a prospective safety assessment framework that can handle a large variety of safety measures, ranging from in-vehicle safety technology, new vehicle types, infrastructure solutions to regulations that influence road user behaviour. It includes methods to project the results in future scenarios and over EU regions for use by policy makers, authorities and consumer organizations. V4Safety strives for comparability of results of safety studies by not only providing the framework but also guidelines for using it. The guidelines show how to select, configure and connect relevant human, vehicle and environment models; how to select a baseline approach and how to project to a conclusion to different regions of interest in the EU. Moreover, the framework will also allow projections for future scenarios, incorporating possible changes in the mobility system. To understand differences between studies and to understand the influence of underlying data, assumptions and models, the method provides tools to characterise the influence of the determinants. Combined with a well-defined baseline approach – what to compare to? - the resulting transparency and consistency in simulation-based safety assessment leads to much improved comparability and reliability of assessment conclusions.	safety, prospective, assessment, framework, measures, policy, authorities, type approval	NEDERLANDSE ORGANISATIE VOOR TOEGEPAST NATUURWETENSCHAPPELIJK ONDERZOEK TNO	BAYERISCHE MOTOREN WERKE AKTIENGESELLSCHAFT, BUNDESANSTALT FUER STRASSENWESEN, CHALMERS TEKNISKA HOGSKOLA AB, FRAUNHOFER GESELLSCHAFT ZUR FORDERUNG DER ANGEWANDTEN FORSCHUNG EV, IDIADA AUTOMOTIVE TECHNOLOGY SA, RHEINISCH-WESTFAELISCHE TECHNISCHE HOCHSCHULE AACHEN, GROUPEMENT D'INTERET ECONOMIQUE DERECHERCHES ET D'ETUDES PSA RENAULT, STICHTING WETENSCHAPPELIJK ONDERZOEK VERKEERSVEILIGHEID SWOV, TECHNISCHE HOCHSCHULE INGOLSTADT, TOYOTA MOTOR EUROPE NV, UNIVERSITA DEGLI STUDI DI FIRENZE, VIRTUAL VEHICLE RESEARCH GMBH, VOLVO PERSONVAGNAR AB, ZF FRIEDRICHSHAFEN AG, EUROPEAN ROAD TRANSPORT TELEMATICS IMPLEMENTATION COORDINATION ORGANISATION, WIJNEN WILLEM	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101075068/program/43108390/details	
Exploring nonclassical states of center-of-mass mechanical motion with superconducting magneto- and levitomechanics (SuperMeQ)	SuperMeQ addresses three basic science goals in quantum technologies, targeting to gain new insights into quantum control over the center-of-mass motion of mechanical resonators: (i) We will push to the limits of decoherence mechanisms of massive objects, (ii) we will maximize the vacuum coupling of the center-of-mass motion of a mechanical resonator to a quantum system, and (iii) we will generate useful nonclassical states such as squeezed states or states with a negative Wigner function, which have direct relevance for quantum-enhanced force and inertial sensing. Our project follows a unique approach by realizing two complementary experimental platforms that are tailored to our goals and that are mutually beneficial through parallel development: (a) magnetically levitated superconducting microparticles that access a mass regime spanning more than seven orders of magnitude between picogram and sub-milligram masses, and that are expected to exhibit ultra-low mechanical decoherence, and (b) integrated clamped magnetic or superconducting mechanical resonators that are expected to reach strong vacuum coupling rates, two orders of magnitude larger than the state-of-the-art. Key in each of these approaches is that we will couple both types of mechanical resonator inductively to superconducting quantum circuits, which allow for full quantum control over the center-of-mass degree of freedom of the mechanical resonators. Our project results will lead to a breakthrough in the development and growth of novel quantum sensing technologies and give new insights into foundational aspects of quantum physics.	decoherence, massive quantum systems, superconducting quantum circuits, nanomechanical resonators, optomechanics	CHALMERS TEKNISKA HOGSKOLA AB	BAYERISCHE AKADEMIE DER WISSENSCHAFTEN, KARLSRUHER INSTITUT FUER TECHNOLOGIE, OESTERREICHISCHE AKADEMIE DER WISSENSCHAFTEN, UNIVERSITAT AUTONOMA DE BARCELONA	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101080143/program/43108390/details

Our approach integrates novel circuit designs and the use of advanced superconducting materials, combined with new characterization methods based on quantum optics techniques. The outcomes of TruePA will highly advance the field of quantum-limited amplifiers providing novel insights into decoherence mechanisms in superconducting circuits and boosting microwave amplification performance in basic science research fields such as quantum information with solid state platforms, astronomy and dark matter search. TruePA brings together internationally known researchers with complementary expertise in the field of superconducting circuits, quantum amplifiers, nanofabrication and quantum optics.

Moreover, NEWGEN will provide online global condition monitoring and novel pre-fault detection methods and instruments for assessing the health status of extruded HVDC cable systems, as well as comprehensive tools and models for the evaluation of life and reliability of extruded HVDC cable systems (cable, joints and terminations) under realistic operation conditions within HVAC/-DC grids (model demonstration via grid-simulations). The new sustainable insulation materials and extrusion solutions will contribute to improved dielectric performance and reliability of extruded insulations needed for reaching TRL maturity for higher rated voltages up to ±600 kV. The uniqueness of the NEWGEN concept is that it is not limited to any specific insulation compound or HV cable manufacturer, but rather the results will impact the whole European HV cable industry for reaching the next generation of reliable-by-design extruded HVDC cables. Moreover, the NEWGEN innovations for online condition monitoring and reliability modelling of HVDC cable systems will allow European transmission system operators (TSOs) to perform comprehensive monitoring and proactive maintenance for their HVDC cable system assets, and to ensure satisfactory firewall properties against disturbances in the hybrid AC/DC network.

ENDING COVID 19 VARIANTS OF CONCERN THROUGH COHORT STUDIES: END-VOC (END-VOC)	The END-VOC consortium will support the European and global response to the COVID-19 pandemic and Variants of Concern (VOC) through well characterised cohorts and linked with existing European and international initiatives. END-VOC consists of 19 partners in Europe (UK, Spain, Italy, Germany, Netherlands, Norway, Italy), South America (Brazil and Peru), Africa (Mozambique, South Africa, Nigeria and 13 ANTICOV African countries), Middle East (Palestine) and Asia (India, Pakistan, Philippines) with a focus on countries affected by VOCs and VOIs. We will elucidate the global circulation of the current and emerging SARS-CoV-2 VOCs and their characteristics, including transmissibility, pathogenicity and propensity to cause reinfection, to support best control strategies and the development of diagnostics; evaluate the impact of VOCs on the effectiveness of different vaccines and vaccination strategies; and assess the implications of VOCs on the choice of optimal treatment options. END-VOC will also investigate how VOCs alter long-term post-infection sequelae and where new VOCs emerge within hosts using our clinical cohorts. We will inform future preparedness and response working closely with international and national public health organisations and existing cohort consortia. Specific beyond state-of-the-art components of END-VOC include the use of novel phylogenetic prediction tools and mathematical modelling; generation of powerful cohorts through sentinel surveillance in low and middle income settings and cohorts of travellers to increase our global reach; use of novel predictive modelling of clinical outcomes by VOC and comorbidity/treatment and evaluation of differences in natural and vaccine immunity by VOC; antiviral screening models within cohorts and an artificial intelligence driven tool for the prediction of long COVID.

Integrated 4D driver modelling under uncertainty (i4Driving)	The vision of i4Driving is to lay the foundation for a new industry-standard methodology to establish a credible and realistic human road safety baseline for virtual assessment of CCAM systems. The two central ideas we propose are (1) a multi-level, modular and extendable simulation library that combines existing and new models for human driving behavior; in combination with (2) an innovative cross-disciplinary methodology to account for the huge uncertainty in both human behaviors and use case circumstances. This rigorous treatment of the uncertainty is crucial to assess how much of our confidence in model inputs, parameters, and structure is justified. It also makes explicit how experts from different disciplines judge the outcomes and how justified the underlying assumptions really are. Our consortium combines all the expertise needed to develop this methodology (e.g., traffic engineering, human factors, data & computer science). We have the experimental means to gather the evidence beyond the state-of-art needed to realistically simulate (near) accidents in multi-driver scenarios (access to many data sources, advanced driving simulators, and field labs). We have a strong international network to collaborate with and harmonize our approach with academic and professional partners in e.g., the US (NADS facility); Australia (UQ advanced driving simulator and TRACSLab connected driving simulator facilities), China (Tongji Univ. 8-dof driving simulator and large-scale field lab) and Japan (NTSEL). Finally, we have all the relevant partners on-board to test and apply the methodology (Universities and research labs, OEMs and Tier 1, vehicle regulators, type-approval authorities, standardization institutes, insurance companies). i4Driving offers a proposition for the short and the longer term: a set of building blocks that pave the way for a driving license for AVs.	human factors; uncertainty; driving simulator;	PANTEIA BV	UNIVERSITA DEGLI STUDI DI NAPOLI FEDERICO II, AIMSUN SLU, TECHNISCHE UNIVERSITEIT DELFT, STATENS VAG- OCH TRANSPORTFORSKNINGSINSTITUT, FUNDACION PARA LA PROMOCION DE LA INNOVACION INVESTIGACION Y DESARROLLO TECNOLOGICO EN LA INDUSTRIA DE AUTOMOCION DE GALICIA, ZF FRIEDRICHSHAFEN AG, DIENST WEGVERKEER (RDW), TECHNISCHE UNIVERSITAET MUENCHEN, TECHNISCHE HOCHSCHULE ASCHAFFENBURG, CONSIGLIO NAZIONALE DELLE RICERCHE, DENSO AUTOMOTIVE DEUTSCHLAND GMBH	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101076165/program/43108390/details	
Clean and efficient microCHCP by micro turbine based hybrid systems (Fit4Micro)	Fit4Micro aims to develop a hybrid microCHP unit running on sustainable liquid biofuels. Application is foreseen at multi-family houses, and more specifically at remote and/or off-grid locations. The innovative system is based on a double shaft micro gas turbine (mGT) combined with a novel humidification unit. This unique combination leads to very high electrical efficiencies (>40%) as well as a very flexible heat:power ratio. Low emissions are achieved by the application of flameless combustion, and a high GHG emission reduction is obtained by using truly advanced, RED2 compliant biofuel. Use of a mGT as core-unit in Fit4Micro is ideal for domestic usage, as the system has very low noise output and is vibration free. Furthermore, rapid response times and fuel-flexible operation make this the ideal base for a highly efficient hybrid CHP system, resilient to changes in (local) fuel and power markets, empowering the consumers through digital solutions. Furthermore, the Fit4Micro unit will be integrated with a compression heat pump, an innovative adsorption and a solar PV system through the DC power system avoiding transmission losses. A smart control system will be developed to enable optimal performance at all times. Efficient fuel distribution and off-grid operation of Fit4Micro is enabled by using sustainable liquid biofuels. These fuels will be produced from biomass residues and organic waste streams, through fast pyrolysis followed by mild hydro-processing yielding a hydrotreated pyrolysis oil (HPO). In Fit4Micro the objective is to widen the feedstock basis and lower the fuel costs by i) using residues as the primary feedstock, and ii) by limiting hydrogen consumption by application of mild processing conditions. Besides technological development work, the Fit4Micro project includes specific activities on socio-economic and environmental sustainability, public perception, gender dimensions, market aspects, the regulatory framework & policies.	micro gas turbine, hybrid heating system, adsorption chiller, biofuel, biomass residues, organic wastes	MITIS	OWI SCIENCE FOR FUELS GMBH, B.T.G.

NOn-VIral gene modified STEM cell therapy (NOVISTEM)	Despite the increasing awareness that cell and gene-therapy approaches have tremendous biomedical potential, their broad clinical application has been challenging due to prolonged and expensive production times and the emergence of severe immune- and gene-delivery dependent side effects. In this proposal, we aim to establish a stream-lined and high-throughput protocol for iPSC-based cell therapy by combining a novel technological platform for gene delivery with a breakthrough biological concept that will permit to manufacture functional, gene-corrected blood forming stem cells and CAR T cells. To achieve this, we will use and optimize photoporation as non-viral gene delivery method for CRISPR-mediated and site-specific gene-editing to obtain controlled CAR expression and for performing gene-correction in iPSCs. From these gene-modified iPSCs, we will generate CAR T cells and blood forming stem cells, respectively, by selectively targeting a signaling pathway that we established to be critical in human blood cell development and particularly T cell development. Following functional validation of the generated cell products, we will optimize the current protocols to increase the potential for clinical implementation and establish a high-throughput photoporation platform to generate a large number of CAR expressing iPSC lines from different ages, sex and ethnicities to demonstrate the population-wide implementation potential of our approach. This will allow to generate a bank of well-characterized, HLA-defined CAR expressing iPSC that can be used as of-the-shelf cell therapy products, thereby significantly advancing the currently implemented adaptive CAR T cell approaches by reducing the production costs and time, by selectively targeting the CAR into a well-controlled location which will prevent variability and by facilitating the production and evaluation of novel CARs for other cancer entities such as solid tumors.	iPSC, CAR T, gene therapy, HSC, non-viral	UNIVERSITEIT GENT		https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101071105/program/43108390/details	
Supervised morphogenesis in gastruloids (SUMO)	The lack of realistic in vitro organ models that can faithfully represent in vivo physiological processes is a major obstacle affecting the biological and medical sciences. The current gold standard is animal experiments, but it is increasingly clear that these models mostly fail to recapitulate the human physiology. Moreover, animal experiments are controversial, and it is a common goal in the scientific community to minimize the use of animals to a strictly necessary minimum. The emergence of stem cell engineered organ models called organoids represents the only viable alternative to animal research. However, current organoid technology is yet to produce the larger physiologically relevant organmodels that the medical sciences really need. Specifically, current organoids are too small, not vascularized and lack the 3-dimensional organization found in vivo. In this interdisciplinary project we aim to challenge all these limitations by using the recently developed gastruloid technology guided by cutting edge bioengineering and artificial intelligence. Gastruloids are formed by initiating the very early developmental processes and develops along a highly coordinated three axial process that closely resembles mammalian embryogenesis. Moreover, gastruloids can develop several organ precursors simultaneously and thus constitutes important improvements over conventional single-tissue organoids. To harvest the potential of gastruloid technology we will first implement large sequencing and imaging experiments to optimize the developmental trajectory of gastruloids for organ inductions. We will then build these datasets into a multimodal data matrix to identify gastruloid candidates for cardiovascular and foregut development. Specifically, we will identify candidates that show strong vasculogenesis as candidates for later vascularisation by anastomose with endothelial cells.	gastruloids, artificial intelligence, closed loop system, organotypic modelling, microfluidic chips, multimodal imaging, raman spectroscopic imaging, microfluidics, interdisciplinary science	OSLO UNIVERSITETSSYKEHUS HF	MAX-PLANCK-GESELLSCHAFT ZUR FORDERUNG DER WISSENSCHAFTEN EV, FORSCHUNGSVERBUND BERLIN EV, TEL AVIV UNIVERSITY	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101071203/program/43108390/details	
Miniaturized LIDAR for MARS Atmospheric Research (MiLi)	Studying the climate on Mars has been a topic for scientific curiosity since long time already. As on Earth, the composition of the Martian atmosphere is a key factor for understanding the climate, which is of vital importance to enable future human exploration of the red planet. The use of Atmospheric LIDAR to characterize densities and sizes of aerosol with a height profile, is commonly used on Earth. However Earth instruments are heavy and with high power consumptions, which make them not easily on-boardables for planetary exploration. MiLi proposes to higher the TRL of 3 basic technologies to enable the construction of a lighter and less power miniaturized LIDAR for Mars atmospheric research.

Climate-resilient management for safe disinfected and non-disinfected water supply systems (SafeCREW)	Safe and affordable supply of drinking water (DW) in the EU under the pressure of climate change is a key priority. Despite long-term experience with the reliable operation of disinfected and non-disinfected drinking water supply systems (DWSS), a number of challenges around microbial stability, the (future) need for disinfection and the consequences of disinfection by-products (DBPs) formation for human health remain open, directly deriving from climate change impacts such as increasing water temperature and higher levels of natural organic matter (NOM). SafeCREW aims to support the novel EU DW Directive by generating advanced knowledge and developing tools and guidelines for disinfected and non-disinfected DWSS and addresses improved comprehensive water quality characterization, novel treatment solutions to actively respond to identified threats, and the management of distribution networks to avoid water quality deterioration up to consumers. Novel data sets on the occurrence and concentration of so far unknown DBPs will be created, and commercial actors stimulated to further develop tools for DBP quantification and mitigation. Transferable tools will be provided to end-users (water utilities, national/EU regulators, researchers, SMEs), including: (I) reliable methods to evaluate microbial stability, characterise NOM, detect DBPs and account for DBP human health toxicity, (II) protocols to select proper materials in contact with disinfected water, (III) monitoring and modelling tools, also exploiting machine learning, for real-time optimisation of DWSS management, and (IV) an integrated risk assessment framework to guide future interventions which ensure that both disinfected and non-disinfected DWSS can continue providing safe DW in the face of climate change. SafeCREW will increase the preparedness of the EU water sector to challenges arising from climate change and will support the EU’s leading position in science-based policy making for DW consumer protection.

STRUCTURAL RELIABLE OFFSHORE FLOATING PV SOLUTION INTEGRATING CIRCULAR CONCRETE FLOATING BREAKWATER (SUREWAVE)	SUREWAVE will develop and test an innovative concept of Floating Photo-Voltaic (FPV) system consisting of an external floating breakwater structure acting as a protection against severe wave-wind-current loads on the FPV modules, allowing increased operational availability and energy output, thus unlocking the massive deployment of Offshore FPV. It will be focused on the research for securing optimal behaviour at aero & hydrodynamic and structural integrity level of the external breakwater, the internal FPV modular structure, the connections, the mooring and anchoring and the whole FPV system, complying with mechanical, electrical (maximizing energy output) and cost-efficiency requirements, ensuring high lifetime of critical components, high reliability of the system and easy, quick and cost-efficient, construction, installation and O&M of the whole system. This will require: 1) the development of novel circular concrete material solutions for the breakwater, cost-effective, easy to produce and with high mechanical, physical and durability properties and low CO2 footprint. 2) the development of an advanced predictive computational modelling and simulation framework: coupled aero & hydrodynamic modelling, Structural integrity modelling, material properties modelling and Structural Health Management to reduce CAPEX and OPEX; 3) the design and implementation of an optimal testing and validation methodology for offshore FPV system to achieve TRL5, including lab testing, basin-model testing and marine environment testing of critical components assuring high resilience to corrosion and biofouling. Maximum advantage of existing expertise will be taken from experts in: offshore wind floating structures, material and phenomena modelling (SINTEF, MARIN, CEIT), design and installation of FPV in calm waters (SIS), floating solutions (CLEMENT), circular structural and non-structural materials (ACC) and in social, environmental and economic assessment (IFEU).

Development of a novel highly efficient energy supply system for energy autonomous multi-family buildings based on biomass gasification coupled with an SOFC and a PV system (Micro-Bio-CHP)	The project aims at the development of an innovative RES-based system for heat and electricity supply in order to achieve an almost energy autonomous multi-family building with regard to heating and electricity consumption as well as electro-mobility. This shall be achieved by integrating a novel highly efficient biomass micro-CHP technology based on an updraft gasifier, a new gas cleaning system and a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC), a state-of-the-art PV system and appropriate innovative energy storage solutions. This system shall be economically highly attractive for future users and it shall also distinguish itself by virtually zero emissions of CO, OGC and dust as well as 55% to 65% reduced NOx emissions compared to other biomass CHP technologies. Consequently, it shall increase the penetration of RES on the multi-family house level and has the potential to significantly contribute to reaching the EU climate and clean air goals. The key innovations of the project are related to the novel micro-scale biomass CHP system. They comprise a flexible partitioning of product gas supplied to the SOFC and to a gas burner in order to cover the overall heat demand and to maximise SOFC operation at the same time, a novel combined thermal and catalytic tar reformer, new highly efficient and durable stack units and a novel compact SOFC system with integrated HCl and H2S removal reactor. Based on a 2.5 kWel SOFC with an electric efficiency of 44%, which is flexibly coupled with a 14 kW gasifier, overall efficiencies of more than 90% shall be gained. A TRL of 5 shall be achieved at the end of the project. The methodology applied to reach these goals relies on technology development tasks (based on process simulations, CFD aided design of the single units, test plant construction, performance and evaluation of test runs), a technology assessment part covering risk, techno-economic, environmental and overall impact assessments as well as targeted dissemination activities.	biomass gasification; thermal and catalytic tar reforming; solid oxide fuel cell; PV system; energy autonomous building; multi-family house	WINDHAGER ZENTRALHEIZUNG TECHNIK GMBH	BIOS BIOENERGIESYSTEME GMBH, FRAUNHOFER GESELLSCHAFT ZUR FORDERUNG DER ANGEWANDTEN FORSCHUNG EV, HYSYTECH SRL, CATATOR AB, WUPPERTAL INSTITUT FUR KLIMA, UMWELT, ENERGIE GGMBH	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101083409/program/43108390/details	
ENERGY PLANNING AND MODELLING THROUGH INTEGRATED ASSESSMENT OF CLIMATE LAND ENERGY WATER NEXUS IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA (EPIC Africa)	Achieving clean energy access and food security targets in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) will require significant infrastructure expansion. Improved policy environments and governance structures are recognised as vital in scaling up funding for climate-resilient investments in renewable energy infrastructures. The efficient exploitation of land, energy and water resources and their synergised use for sustainable economic development, as well as their robustness to stressors from climate change require integrated optimisation and assessment of strategic plans in these sectors. Working with existing, widely adopted, open-source modelling tools and data, the EPIC Africa project will build on the transparent integrated assessment, and resource modelling, connecting to the already existing community of developers and users. The project will create a network of African experts to train, co-create and sustain the tools developed in the long term, which is lacking at the moment. The project will build advanced and spatially contextualised water-energy-food (WEF) models for long-term infrastructure planning. Operational WEF models with sufficient temporal and spatial resolution will be developed and used to verify cost-optimised infrastructure investment plans under different climate and socioeconomic scenarios. EPIC Africa sets out to support governance of sustainable development in SSA by forming and connecting a transition arena with stakeholders in dialogue, leading to the development of a WEF nexus digital engagement tool. Optimal use of shared resources will be exemplified for Africa using the cases of the Volta and Tana river basins. Here, we will design specific policy, investment and infrastructure plans for the coming decades in the agricultural, water and energy access sectors. The project will produce a set of institutional, regulatory and technical recommendations for sustainable management of optimised transition pathways.

European Eddy-RIch ESMs (EERIE)	Eddy Rich Earth System Models (EERIE) will develop a new generation of Earth System Models (ESMs) that are capable of explicitly representing a crucially important, yet unexplored regime of the Earth system, the ocean mesoscale. Leveraging the latest advances in science and technology, EERIE will substantially improve the ability of such ESMs to faithfully represent the centennial-scale evolution of the global climate, especially its variability, extremes and how tipping points may unfold under the influence of the ocean mesoscale. Model improvements include new dynamical cores, new components (particularly sea ice), scale-aware parametrization and the complementary use of Machine Learning (ML) The technological challenge associated with this ambition is very high. EERIE’s goal is to achieve a simulation speed of up to 5 simulated years per day (5 SYPDs) and to make efficient use (reduction in power consumption by 50%) of the pre-exascale supercomputers now available in Europe. The technological solutions that are to be leveraged in EERIE are the use of reduced precision, GPUs, ML and reduced I/O. Alongside model improvements, EERIE will develop innovative experimental simulation protocols that are suitable for the mesoscale, to be pioneered on behalf of the global climate modelling community, in preparation for the next IPCC. EERIE will produce useful and usable climate information that will contribute to national and international climate change assessments such as IPCC; it will incorporate model variability and extremes within an Integrated Assessment Model (IAM) via a MLemulato;, and it will deliver storyline approaches to the consequences of climate tipping points and disease outbreaks.

Metal Organic Frameworks for Hydrogen production by photocatalytic overall water splitting (MOF2H2)	The decarbonation of several sectors (energy, transport, carbon intensive industries like steel or ammonia) is depending on the availability of low carbon hydrogen. However, current hydrogen production processes are mostly carbonated, and existing decarbonated processes suffer from several disadvantages (high costs, issues for coupling with intermittent electricity, etc.). The MOF2H2 project positions itself as a game changer to produce hydrogen from water through a more sustainable process: photocatalytic overall water splitting using non-noble materials. Built upon a breakthrough discovery made by ESPCI and UPV recently patented, MOF2H2 aims to develop a world-record efficiency for sun-driven clean hydrogen production reaching 5% solar-to-hydrogen efficiency, using metal organic framework (MOF) as photocatalysts. To this end, MOF2H2 will gather 10 partners (and affiliated entities) for 36 months, including some of the best researchers in the world in their fields, for demonstrating three lab-scale photocatalysis prototypes with fine-tuned materials dedicated to hydrogen production, hence reaching TRL4. After having a clear vision of overall specifications through WP1, a first-generation MOF will be synthetised and optimised through metal nanoparticles co-deposition in WP2, also guided by modelling and advanced characterisation from WP3. To reach even higher efficiencies, a refined MOF will be produced in WP4 following metal/ligand substitution. The MOF synthesis will be optimised and upscaled under sustainable and economically viable conditions in WP5, and followed by MOFs integration in a lab-scale demonstrator, for showing the reliability of their operation at lab-scale and their long-term performance. A complete sustainability and an economic potential assessment will be conducted in WP6. Through a tailored dissemination and communication strategy elaborated in WP7, the project is expected to have a high impact on both the academic and industrial sectors.

Advanced HYBRID solar plant with PCM storage solutions in sCO2 cycles. (HYBRIDplus)	HYBRIDplus:Advanced HYBRID solar plant with PCM storage solutions in sCO2 cycles. HYBRIDplus aims to pioneer the next generation of CSP with an advanced innovative high-density and high-temperature thermal energy storage (TES) system capable of providing a high degree of dispatchability at low cost and with much lower environmental burden than the State of the Art. This thermal storage is based in the Phase Change Material (PCM) technology in a cascade configuration that can reproduce the effect of a thermocline and integrates recycled metal wool in its nucleus that provide hybridization possibilities by acting as an electric heater transforming non-dispatchable renewable electricity such as PV into thermal stored energy ready to be dispatched when needed. HYBRIDplus proposes a novel approach to concentrated solar power with a PV+Cascade PCM-TES CSP configuration based on a high temperature supercritical CO2 cycle working at 600 ºC. This new plant is called to form the backbone of the coming energy system thanks to a higher efficiency and lower LCoE than state-of-the-art technology, and in addition to other benefits such as full dispatchability reached with the hybridization in the storage that allow higher shares of variable output renewables in the energy system and environmental friendliness (lower CO2 emissions, minimum water consumption, enhancement life cycle impact).

WorldTrans - TRANSPARENT ASSESSMENTS FOR REAL PEOPLE (WorldTrans)	There are a few important working hypotheses that lie behind our choice of approach to this call. For Europe to deliver on its Green Deal ambition (to make Europe’s economy climate neutral by 2050), we believe that citizen engagement stakeholder engagement may be as important as dry facts and figures. People (not economies) react to climate change, people make decisions to act or not to act. Such is the nature of a democratic process. It is this realization that has made us choose to address transparency, openness, engagement and to work with models of the system, not its parts. WorldTrans will focus on three key limitations of the state-of-the-art of IAMs, namely: 1 Weak representation of social, human and economic heterogeneity; 2 Limited representation of feedbacks between the domains of nature and humans; and 3 Lack of transparency with respect to the inner workings of the models as well as with respect to the uptake of results and involvement of citizens and stakeholders, including limited assessment and traceability of uncertainty. We will address systemic, structural deficiencies in current IAMs rather than making incremental improvements. In doing so, we sacrifice details of any particular sector or process, instead capturing the essences of their functions in order to focus on how those processes affect each other within and across domains.

ORU BASED ON BUILDING BLOCKS FOR ADVANCED ASSEMBLY OF SPACE SYSTEMS (ORU-BOAS)	"ORU-BOAS (ORU based on Building Blocks for On Orbit Advanced Assembly of Space Systems) project will develop and demonstrate an ORU concept (TRL 6) based on the Building Blocks developing in previous SRC calls and PERASPERA/EOF objectives. The main points to be developed are: - An ORU compatible with the different SI, payloads and services as indicated in the topic reaching finally a TRL 5/6 - This ORU to be used as ""plug&play"" module for the topic HORIZON-CL4-2022-SPACE-01-11 (In Orbit Demonstration phase) - To develop a Satellite Construction Kit user cases for future application in ISMA (In Space Manufacturing and Assembly) missions - The ORU design concept will include an AppStore and Open-Architecture mentality for the different modules as avionics. The ORU will be designed in a modular concept in order to be flexible and provide capabilities to upgrades in an efficient manner. This project will consider the needs and requirements of current PERASPERA projects: EROSS+ and PERIOD. The ORU-BOAS consortium is formed by SENER Aeroespacial (coordinator), Thales Alenia Space France, Thales Alenia Space Italy, ISISPACE and DLR.

High-Energy Accelerators for Radiation Testing and Shielding (HEARTS)	The main purpose of the HEARTS proposal is to provide high-energy (>100 MeV/n) heavy ion accelerator access to space users, in order to mimic the effects of Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCR) at ground level, and thus fulfilling the needs of microelectronics qualification and shielding & radiobiology experiments. These ions will successfully mimic the effects of heavy ions present in the GCR spectrum, and will also ensures penetration levels large enough to enable electronics testing in air, without the need of electronics device preparation (e.g. de-lidding, thinning) and at board and box level. High penetration ion irradiation is essential in order to facilitate the exploitation of high-end microelectronics technology in space, for e.g. onboard artificial intelligence or Big Data processing applications. To this end, the HEARTS proposal features CERN and GSI as accelerator infrastructure partners, who also gather a vast experience and knowledge in radiation effects on electronics, and shielding & radiobiology, respectively. Moreover, HEARTS features also the University of Padova as academic partner, and Thales Alenia Space and Airbus Defence and Space as industrial participants, all of which have ample experience in the radiation effects domain, and a strong interest in VHE ion testing. The academic and industrial partners will define the requirements, both technical and procedural, for VHE ion user facilities. Such requirements will serve as input to CERN and GSI and will be implemented as upgrade which, once completed, will be scrutinized and validated by the industrial and academic partners, through “real case” experimental campaigns that will in turn serve as input for the development of VHE ion testing recommendations and guidelines. Therefore, in final instance, HEARTS ambitions to create a high quality and sustainable VHE ion irradiation capacity in Europe, accessible to and tailored for space users and applications.

Autonomous Living Cell analYsis ON-chip for Evaluation of space Environment Effects: low-power integrated lab-on-chip for the assessment of radiation damage on living systems in nanosatellite missions (ALCYONE)	The project aims at the design and realization of a new analytical platform implementing a series of innovative technologies able to provide a highly-integrated solution for the analysis in-situ of the effects of the space environment on model biological systems and for the evaluation of shielding technologies combined with radioprotective agents. The main objective of the project will be achieved through the development of a lab-on-chip device with integrated thin-film sensors and actuators that will implement an extremely compact cell-incubator capable to sample the status of the cell culture during a space mission using real-time monitoring techniques based on bioluminescence. Genetically modified microorganisms will be designed in order to monitor specific stress responses based on a luciferase-based reporter system. An electronic system will be integrated in the platform for the characterization of the radiation environment allowing to evaluate the correlation between observed biological effects and radiation exposure. The main features of the proposed technology include low power consumption, extreme compactness, high data efficiency and full automation making it suitable for cubesat missions. In particular, a complete cubesat payload will be designed to address and solve any integration issue and to provide a test bench for a preliminary set of experiments to be carried out on ground facilities simulating the deep space environment. The proposed system will therefore represent a key element to pave the route toward deep space human mission as it offers the possibility to test the effects of long term exposure to the space environment on model biological systems using simple platforms as cubesats. This opens new scenarios where minor effort will be required to plan multiple low-cost missions for improving the risk modeling and for testing new countermeasures in a continuous-improvement scheme.	lab-on-chip, integrated thin-film devices, biosensor, bioluminescence, cell incubator, space environment effects, radiation damage, dosimetry, cubesat, nanosatellites	UNIVERSITA DEGLI STUDI DI ROMA LA SAPIENZA	UNIVERSITEIT TWENTE, KAYSER ITALIA SRL, ALMA MATER STUDIORUM, UNIVERSITA DEGLI STUDI DI ROMA TOR VERGATA, KARLSRUHER INSTITUT FUER TECHNOLOGIE	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101082679/program/43108390/details	
Full eurOpean hdi pCb and assembly sUpply chain for Space and INdustrial seGments (FOCUSING)	FOCUSING is a powerful playground in which outstanding, worldwide recognized European companies with complementary expertise and state-of-the-art facilities will share and merge their experience with the ultimate goal of exploring and exploiting novel green-oriented routes towards the significant upgrading of the current printed circuit board (PCB) and surface mount technology (SMT) and the enhancement of the overall European competitiveness. Even though space market is addressed in priority, other applications may be addressed. The growing trend towards miniaturization and the demand of ever more compact and integrated devices have led to an ever increasing interest in printed circuit board with embedded components and in HDI boards, both for the multiple potentialities of a technical-productive nature, and for the encouraging growth prospects of the market demand. Despite improved manufacturing HDI technologies have been widely demonstrated, and exploited e.g. for automotive, biomedical, and commercial applications, incorporating these improvements in capability with space reliability requirements still representing a challenge. In this project, HDI technology is considered pivotal for the integration of cutting-edge electronic solutions able to revolutionize the design of present and future products (e.g. from standard sized to micro and nano satellites) by reducing the payload and boosting the performances of the space equipment. The objective of the proposed activity is double : • To develop and validate state-of-the-art building blocks to demonstrate the reliability of the technologies and processes developed • To build a fully European competitive, sustainable and independent supply chain based on state-of-the-art laminates and cutting-edge HDI PCB manufacturing technology focused on advanced Space applications but potentially benefiting as well to other applications.

Dust Study, Transport, and Electrostatic Removal for Exploration Missions (DUSTER)	International scientific and commercial interests in exploration missions to solar system bodies such as the Moon, asteroids and comets have increased significantly. Several exploration missions are planned in the near future, in particular to the Moon. One major environmental constraint during those missions is the presence of charged dust-like particles, as they can degrade equipment by accelerating wear. Moreover, exposure to and inhalation of dust can have a range of toxic effects on human explorers. There is a recognised need for developing efficient dust mitigation systems. To develop such systems, (i) better knowledge and models of dust charging and transportation in those environments are needed, and (ii) technologies to move charged dust particles in a controlled way must be validated. The objective of the DUSTER project is to develop an instrument for in situ analysis of dust-like particles and their transport in the context of planetary and small body exploration missions. This instrument will be designed to measure for which set of parameters (electrostatic charging of particles, ambient plasma, imposed electric field) dust-like particles can be moved. The technology developed can serve as a basis to design electrostatic dust mitigation devices and dust sample-collecting equipment. The above-mentioned parameters will be determined theoretically and supported by laboratory-based measurements for particles with different properties and under different conditions. Following the requirements derived from the simulations and laboratory measurements, the individual sub-units and units of the proposed instrument will be designed. An integrated breadboard version of the instrument will be manufactured and tested with the same laboratory setup. The target is to reach TRL 4. The development, manufacturing, testing and validation of the instrument will be a joint effort between scientific, engineering and industrial teams with a strong interdisciplinary approach.

Space qualified GAN Components for Next generation systems (SGAN-Next)	The main objective of SGAN-Next is to develop a fully European GaN on SiC foundry process and demonstrate outstanding performance at high frequency beyond Q-band, through the design of efficient and robust SSPA, LNA and switch devices for flexible LEO/GEO payloads. For this purpose, the project led by SENER as satellite equipment manufacturer, includes an epitaxy manufacturer (SweGaN), an industrial foundry (UMS), a research foundry (FBH) and two Universities (UNIBO and UAB). Moreover, the consortium count on the two main European satellite prime contractors (ADS and TAS) for the conceptual definition of services and the required system to answer market demand. SGaN-Next aims to secure a European supply chain with GaN epitaxial wafers provided by SweGaN. For this new process, Q/V band power cells will be designed making use of novel processing modules and epitaxial concepts which reduce parasitic losses and increase thermal drain to heat sink. In parallel, UMS provides access to its 0.1-µm GaN technology (GH10-10), which will be optimized and submitted to a space qualification assessment through two runs available for MMICs design and validation. Microwave characterisation of GaN technology performance by model refinement and device characterisation will be addressed to improve MMIC design process along the project. As highly efficient PAs are essential for Telecom active antennas with high number of active units, at least three PAs design concepts are proposed to answer the needs identified at equipment level. The efficiency has a critical impact on the extra power demanded to the system and the increased complexity to dissipate. On the reception side, a design of a LNA as well as a switch for robust RF front-end will be addressed. Last, but not least, packaging techniques will be evaluated for space use and finally, a demonstrator of an SSPA for actual antenna systems based on the designed MMIC’s will be developed and tested under space environmental conditions.

Nanomechanical Hardware Platforms for Edge Computing (i-EDGE)	Challenging operating environments are common across many important internet of things (IoT) applications related to enterprises and the circular economy, including automotive, aerospace, industrial and power generation. However, conventional electronics are not suitable for operation in challenging and harsh environments, e.g. at high temperatures. i-EDGE establishes an enabling nanoelectromechanical (NEM) switch technology platform for IoT edge devices operating under demanding conditions, i.e., high temperature (<300 °C) and/or high-radiation (<1 Mrad), uses zero standby power, non-volatile memory and has low compute performance requirements. i-EDGE will realize a proof-of-concept demonstrator of a NEM “system-on-chip” (SoC) IoT node with an FPGA, non-volatile memory, and a temperature sensor, powered by a high-temperature capacitor bank, with a wireless power receiver for trickle charging the capacitor, and a simple data transceiver and sensor readout to interface to the on-chip FPGA and non-volatile memory. The FPGA fabric will be based on the NEM switch technology for digital logic, and integrated with a non-volatile memory array, analog utility blocks for wireless power transfer, data exchange and sensor readout. We will develop a NEM physical design kit (PDK) for design and circuit simulation, which will facilitate broad usage by application engineers. The technology and design flow will be demonstrated with a condition monitoring application, that has been developed for industrial IoT processes. In several previous EU and national projects, our technology has matured to TRL3 and i-EDGE will bring it to TRL5. The i-EDGE consortium has all expertise to establish a full supply chain, from basic logic and memory cell design to Systems-on-Chip and a migration path to pilot manufacturing of the NEM technology in Europe. Thus, i-EDGE will help position the EU at the cutting edge of chip design and manufacturing capabilities, as envisaged by the EU Chips Act.

CENTAUR - COPERNICUS ENHANCED TOOLS FOR ANTICIPATIVE RESPONSE TO CLIMATE CHANGE IN THE EMERGENCY AND SECURITY DOMAIN (CENTAUR)	Within HORIZON-CL4-2021-SPACE-01-43 - Copernicus Security and Emergency Services evolution, the objective of CENTAUR is to respond to societal challenges deriving from Climate Change threats by developing and demonstrating new service components for the Copernicus Emergency Management Service (CEMS) and Copernicus Service in Support to EU External Action service (SEA), aiming to: 1. Improve situational awareness and preparedness around climate change and its impact on complex emergencies and multi-dimensional (security) crises; 2. Anticipate the occurrence and possible knock-on effects of crisis events, in particular those triggered by climatic extremes, thus contributing to resilience and effective adaptation. In the emergency domain, CENTAUR will address the flood-related threats to population, assets and infrastructures in urban areas. In the Security domain, CENTAUR will address water & food insecurity. The two work streams will be connected via a cross-cutting component focusing on exposure and vulnerability to climate change, as well as resilience and societal capacity for managing environmental risks and social conflict. Across work streams, indicators and models will be validated by different methods. CENTAUR will integrate data coming from multiple heterogeneous sources, with a specific focus on those generated by other Copernicus services, and, in particular, those of the Climate Change Service). It will combine these with meteorological data, socio-economic data, and data coming from new sensors (e.g. traditional and social media). Thus, it will enhance current capacities to produce composite risk indexes and to perform multi-criteria analyses in the emergency and security domains.

Space Application GaN transistor (SAGAN)	The SAGAN proposal addresses a crucial element in future satellite platforms and payloads. Spacecraft Electrical Power Systems (EPS) are a key element that enable space missions. Without an efficient EPS, many of the capabilities that we take today for granted, such as high-speed communications, GNSS and science payloads, would not be possible. Power transistors are key elements of the electrical units that form the EPS and other systems, since they allow the most efficient (in terms of power and mass) electrical power processing topologies. During the last decade, several technological advancements have enabled a new type of transistors based on Gallium Nitride over Silicon. GaN transistors allow a reduction in mass of the equipment that uses them and a reduction in power consumption. Currently, Europe does not have the capabilities to produce GaN transistors for space unless relying on external countries for most of the supply chain, which is something that cannot be taken for granted. The objective of the SAGAN proposal is to overcome this situation by establishing a non-dependent supply chain (design, manufacturing, processing, and qualification testing) for GaN transistors that are suitable for space applications. The transistors will be tested to assess radiation effects, thermal dynamics, structural behaviour, reliaability... To achieve it, a strong consortium has been established. It is composed by organisations that have the knowleadge and the facilities to fulfil the objective. The consortium is composed of a company devoted to space level GaN transistors and integrated circuit design (SEMI ZABALA), a research foundry (IMEC), a company that processes wafers to the standards required by the technology (DISCO HI-TEC) and a satellite equipment manufacturer with component packaging capabilities (SENER). The consortium also counts with the role of GaN transistor end user, which is played by SENER as spacecraft equipment manufacturer.

Dispatchable concentrated Solar-to-X energy solution for high penetration of renewable energy (SOLARX)	Current energetic infrastructures are inefficient and hardly capable of integrating a large share of intermittent renewable energy sources. Carbon-neutral and high efficiency energy production adapted to local demands would be a breakthrough. SOLARX integrates 3 high concentration solar technologies and AI based smart resource management, to produce - either directly with high efficiencies or through storage stages for maximizing revenues - mainly electricity, heat for storage and/or SHIP and green H2 or Syngas in a carbon neutral way. Three Key Technological Elements will be developed: a smart solar resource management algorithm which aims to meet local instantaneous energy demands, a high efficiency CPV receiver and a carbon negative bi-energy H2 receiver. SOLARX’s main goal is to demonstrate the technical, economic and social relevance, at the laboratory scale, of the synergetic efficient production of heat, electricity and H2 from solar resource in a single facility, considering energy demands and market prices for a wide range of locations and application scenarios. SOLARX global assessment will demonstrate its role as a Game-changing RES within the framework of future implementation in a carbon-negative energy system. SOLARX will also provide power-to-X for larger integration of intermittent energy sources into the electric grid. The high efficiency concentration technologies allow to reduce the environmental impacts with respect to current technologies, as LCA study will demonstrate. Also, social acceptance and socioeconomic impacts will be assessed, on the base of, among others, previous high concentration experiences. The regulatory frameworks will be considered within the roadmap towards the technology commercialization and policy recommendations will be published. The share of SOLARX in the SHIP, electricity and renewable H2 global market by 2050 is expected to be 2-5%, 2-5% and 1-3%, respectively, while reducing by 1.5 GtCO2/year the emissions.

Freestanding energy-to-Hydrogen fuel by water splitting using Earth-abundant materials in a novel, eco-friendly, sustainable and scalable photoelectrochemical Cell system (FreeHydroCells)	The FreeHydroCells project aims to create a new photoelectrochemical system capable of clean, efficient solar-to-chemical energy conversion, with hydrogen gas storing the chemical energy. The system would mimic the solar-energy absorption potential of a leaf by arraying cascades of nanometre thick semiconducting materials as buried pn-junctions that, when submerged in water and exposed to sunlight, are capable of freestanding photoelectrochemical water splitting. A number of technological challenges restrict the cost-effective efficiency of clean, green, solar-to-chemical hydrogen, state-of-the-art systems, making it commercially unattractive, and severely limiting hydrogen’s role in decarbonisation. However, the FreeHydroCells project proposes to leverage a number of advancements in thin film materials, devices, and processes to make similar breakthroughs in photoelectrochemical band-engineering for interconnected bands, defect minimisation, thin film thickness uniformity continuity to minimise drift-dominated transit times, carrier doping for high conductivity, carrier type selectivity and, importantly, preventing significant recombination of light-generated carriers by ensuring drift transport under multiple in-built electric fields. These breakthroughs would transform the transfer efficiency of solar-to-chemical energy via the carefully aligned redox potential and propel the photoelectrochemical water splitting reactions to morph solar energy into hydrogen bonds. The new materials system could be cost-effectively realised through modified delivery techniques of atomic layer deposition and chemical vapour deposition in manufacturing-compatible, large-area capable, equipment that is now common in commercial chip and solar cell processing technologies. FreeHydroCells’ multidisciplinary expertise is key to making this substantial science-to-technology leap: to verify a paradigm proof-of-concept for a self-driven system suitable for up-scaling and commercialisation.

Multiscale modelling for wind farm design, performance assessment and loading (MERIDIONAL)	The wind industry is developing wind turbines and airborne wind energy devices which span altitudes well above the well-studied surface layer. A full understanding of the unsteady inflow conditions which drive loads and performance at these altitudes is lacking. MERIDIONAL will provide a comprehensively validated tool chain based on an open-source platform which will draw on an integrated knowledge and data hub to allow the efficient and accurate assessment of the performance and loads experienced by onshore, offshore, and airborne wind energy systems. This tool chain can be used for component, device and plant level planning and operation. It will consist of models which can capture the unsteady time-resolved inflow structures which drive performance and loads within the wind plant, incorporating inter and intra farm turbine interactions. Inflow conditions will be analysed and modelled beyond the surface layer to capture the conditions within and above the atmospheric boundary layer. This is critical to a full understanding of the loads and performance of wind farms and airborne wind energy devices. Model validation will be underpinned by a range of high quality and unique datasets drawing on high-fidelity simulations, and kite-borne, lidar, drone and mast measurements from field test campaigns in complex terrain, offshore and airborne. The strength of the tool chain results from developing different models for different situations, using higher order approaches (e.g., meso and microscale LES) when required and lower order models (physics or data-driven) where these are sufficient to accurately predict loads and performance. The knowledge and data hub will allow users of the tool chain to draw on a wide range of existing and project-generated measurement and simulation data to allow site specific analysis to be carried out at any location. MERIDIONAL allows stakeholders to increase wind plant efficiency and reduce material costs through less conservative design.

A circular by design environmentally friendly geothermal energy solution based on a horizontal closed loop - HOCLOOP (HOCLOOP)	Geothermal energy has a large potential as a clean renewable energy source. The conventional technology is mainly based on heat extraction from hot permeable aquifers. Such aquifers are hard to find, limit the applications and imply high cost and risks. The proposed project aims to mitigate this challenge. The idea is to use an innovative horizontal closed loop solution for the extraction of heat from deep or shallow formation rocks. The solution is based on new drilling technology and solves the challenges of conventional construction of geothermal wells. The solution will improve the power production due to extended reach horizontal drilling with a large hole size. Further improvement is expected to be achieved by use of alternative circulation fluids to water, such as CO2 based fluids. It is expected that the solution can reduce the LCOE compared to the conventional solution and meet the SET plan targets. The project will develop the tools to enable the proposed geothermal solution and demonstrate the technology in a full-scale test operation to TRL5. The work will cover the development and validation of models for the heat flow and investigate the possibility for improving the electricity production by using alternative fluids to water. The work will also cover the investigation of potential EU pilot sites, environmental assessment, and the social acceptance. It is expected that the solution will enable exploitation of geothermal energy sources in new regions with- or without good hydrothermal reservoirs. The solution is foreseen to be integrated with other renewables to improve the reliability of the power supply and grid stability, and to be applicable to a variety of geological conditions. It is also expected to solve the main issues of geothermal energy related to emissions, seismicity, and environmental aspects. 9 partners from 6 European countries with complementary expertise join forces for this 42 months project.

Synergetic integration of BIOteChnology and thermochemical CaTalysis for the cAscade coNvErsion of organic waste to jet-fuel (BIOCTANE)	The reduction of GHG emissions according to the Paris Agreement is particularly challenging regarding the production of “green” liquid fuels with a high energy density for the aviation sector (drop-in biokerosene). In this context, the BIOCTANE project aims to develop and optimize an innovative process for the conversion of organic waste materials naturally characterized by a high-water content (e.g. food-waste, organic material from the food processing industry) into carbon-neutral market-ready drop-in jet-fuels. In particular, BIOCTANE project will develop a proof of concept on the synergetic coupling of biotechnological and thermocatalytic processing routes by a disruptive and interdisciplinary strategy that will result in an efficient valorization of the organic wastes into renewable jet-fuel, maximizing the recovery of chemical energy, nutrients and carbon use. First, the complex organic waste will be converted into platform molecules (acetoin and 2,3-butanediol) by creating a breakthrough link between biotechnological processing of biowaste and hydrothermal gasification technology. Subsequently, a novel one-pot chemical process will be developed by the combination of different catalytic steps through which the platform molecules are converted to jet-fuel range hydrocarbons. Based on an extensive process flow modelling, the process efficiency and the techno-economic requirements for full market integration as well as the environmental impact will be assessed.

MODULAR MODEL-BASED DESIGN AND TESTING FOR APPLICATIONS IN SATELLITES (METASAT)	The space domain, as many other engineering sectors, is actively considering novel methods and tools based on artificial intelligence, Digital Twins, virtual design and testing, and other Industry 4.0 concepts, in order to manage the increased complexity of the design of upcoming satellites. Nevertheless, especially from the satellite on-board software engineering point of view, these technologies require a solid ground to be built upon. First of all, the computational power of the hardware platform must meet the needs of the advanced algorithms running on top of it. The software layer too must both allow an efficient use of the hardware resources and at the same time guarantee non-functional properties such as dependability in compliance with ECSS standards. Finally, the design methods need to adapt to the specific challenges posed by both the increased complexity of the hardware/software layers and the Industry 4.0 concepts. The METASAT vision is that a design methodology based on Model-Based engineering jointly with the use of open architecture hardware constitutes that solid ground. To reach its vision, METASAT will leverage existing software virtualisation layers (e.g., hypervisors), that already provide guarantees in terms of standards compliance, on top of high-performance computing platforms based on open hardware architectures. The focus of the project will be on the development of a toolchain to design software modules for this hardware/software layer. Without such measures the time and cost of developing new systems could become prohibitive as system complexity grows, reducing competitiveness, innovation, and potentially dependability across the industry. A high quality and complementary consortium comprising knowledge generators (IKL, BSC and ALES), plus an SME technology integrator (FEN) and an end user from the space sector (OHB), will be able to test in a real scenario the new design toolchain that will enable the runtime deployment of software module	model-based engineering, hypervisor, Artificial Intelligence, RISC-V, Fault detection, isolation and recovery (FDIR)	BARCELONA SUPERCOMPUTING CENTER CENTRO NACIONAL DE SUPERCOMPUTACION	IKERLAN S.

Transformative Change in Telecoupled Agrofood Systems for Biodiversity and Equity (TC4BE)	Demand for agricultural commodities from EU agrofood systems are driving land use change in biodiversity-rich countries in the Global South, leading to major biodiversity losses. Tackling the EU’s global biodiversity footprint is a top EU policy priority. The science demonstrates the need for transformative change in economic, social, and financial models for safe and just transitions, but there is limited knowledge on how to achieve transformative change in practice, which requires navigation of biodiversity, climate and equity trade-offs and synergies. TC4BE will support transdisciplinary research on different dimensions and scales of telecoupled agrofood systems, engaging diverse stakeholders, including EU and producer-country policy-makers and Indigenous Peoples and local communities. Scenarios and modelling of EU agrofood systems transformations, will be complemented by analysis of EU governance, trade, legal, consumer, collective action and sustainable finance levers and social innovations. In three producer countries (Cameroon, Colombia, and Kenya), TC4BE will generate methods for and assess land use change drivers, at-risk biodiversity hotspots, and the effectiveness of Sustainable Landscapes Initiatives. In six landscapes TC4BE will explore relationships to nature, perceptions of socio-ecological histories and futures, rigorously evaluate SLIs, and conduct regenerative enterprise case studies using a structured landscape learning process. Transformative change pathways will be co-generated by diverse stakeholders recognizing plural values and informed by new evidence, decision-making tools and training modules. The overall process will strengthen the capacity of participating stakeholders (care-knowledge-agency) to influence biodiversity and equity outcomes. A global dialogue, facilitated by the Global Landscapes Forum will link the transdisciplinary processes between the scales, supported by additional dissemination and communication activities.

Boosting SUstaiNability, Reliability and EfficiencY of perovskite PV through novel materials and process engineering. (SUNREY)	Perovskite photovoltaics have seen rapid advances in the last decade with the promise of higher efficiency, reduced embedded energy and CO2 emissions, low-temperature production for versatile applications such as flexible photovoltaics and all at potentially much lower cost than current Si technology. However, poor stability and short lifetime in the field is holding back wide deployment of perovskite photovoltaics. The current best performing materials also contain lead (Pb) which is toxic and damaging to health and the environment. To address these limitations, SUNREY will tackle the root causes of these limiting factors through a suite of innovations covering all aspects of the device design and manufacture including improvements to the stability/performance ratio of the perovskite materials themselves, development of new charge transport and electrode materials and low-cost deposition methods that can be configured to different perovskite absorbers, development of improved stability Pb-free materials, development of a range of measures for barriers and encapsulation from layers to module and process optimisation. These technology developments will be underpinned by new approaches to degradation mechanism analysis and the incorporation of modelling to combine barrier properties data with device performance models and test data. The design process will be driven by lifecycle, circularity and sustainability analyses. Developments will be validated to TRL5 through testing by an accredited laboratory under both realistic laboratory conditions and outdoors. SUNREY targets a breakthrough combination of high efficiency (25% Pb-based, 15% Pb-free) with long lifetime (25 years), reduced emissions and cost of manufacturing compared to Si. This will open up a wide range of new opportunities for the consortium companies including utility-scale panels, IoT and MicroPower, Independent Power Sources, Building Applied Utility Power (BAPV) Building-Integrated Photovoltaics.

Propelling eUropean Leadership through Synergizing Aviation Research (PULSAR)	Aviation sector faces many challenges such as achieving technological breakthroughs, reducing its environmental impact and increasing the sector’s workforce skills while complying with new EU policies and priorities such as the European Green Deal, the new European industrial policy as well as the European digital strategy. A policy-driven European aviation R&I framework is needed more than ever. The primary goal of PULSAR is to support the European policy-makers in identifying the key aviation research efforts to carry out until 2050 and beyond with respect to environmental objectives, associated regulations and expectations of the European citizens. PULSAR will develop the European Aviation R&I Roadmap and will provide associated recommendations. PULSAR will focus on the environmental aspects of the overall roadmap, i.e., on technologies that may affect aviation noise and emissions, both for impacts on climate (CO2 and non-CO2 effects) and for Local Air Quality (LAQ). The project also aims at fostering connection of aviation R&I with education and skills, and communicating about European aviation R&I to citizens and relevant stakeholders. Coordinated by ONERA, PULSAR gathers a multidisciplinary consortium of 12 partners, composed of industrial partners, SMEs, RTOs, universities and an association, relying on a large group of experts such as ENEA and ECATS and clusters whose expertise and complementarity are crucial for the achievement of the project’s objectives. PULSAR will deliver: • A R&I roadmap assessing the impact of technologies on environmental issues and stating the R&I effort needed to achieve environmental goals; • An educational roadmap to guide training of future experts for sustainable aviation; • A thorough communication towards citizens on how the sector is committed to lower its environmental footprint; • A European platform for Environmental Aviation, embedding all project outputs, being an open access reference for environmental aviation.	aviation roadmap, education, training, environmental goals, noise, emission, SAF, disruptive technologies, local air quality, greenhouse gas	OFFICE NATIONAL D'ETUDES ET DE RECHERCHES AEROSPATIALES	SAFRAN AIRCRAFT ENGINES, ROLLS-ROYCE DEUTSCHLAND LTD & CO KG, AIRBUS OPERATIONS SAS, DEUTSCHES ZENTRUM FUR LUFT, STICHTING KONINKLIJK NEDERLANDS LUCHT, Anotec Engineering, S.L., AIRPORT REGIONS COUNCIL, ERDYN CONSULTANTS SARL	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101095395/program/43108390/details	
Breaking the Resolution Limit in Two-Photon Microscopy Using Negative Photochromism (4for2)	Multiphoton microscopy is a benchmark tool in biomedical research, used for the fluorescence imaging in cellular environments. This has important implications for disease diagnosis and the monitoring of therapy response. In conventional two-photon microscopy the fluorescence intensity of the employed molecular probe is proportional to the square of the excitation light intensity, implying that the fluorescence from the sample is confined around the focal point, yielding good spatial resolution. The spatial resolution can be dramatically improved by drawing on higher-order processes such as four-photon absorption. However, its practical implementation imposes major technical challenges, such as extreme laser intensities in the deep NIR. For this reason four-photon microscopy has so far attracted academic interest only. The present proposal addresses this issue and provides a multidisciplinary answer to the question: Can we develop a technique that offers spatial resolution of four-photon microscopy, but relies on two-photon absorption? This would combine the upsides of two-photon microscopy (low excitation energies provided by standard lasers at around 800 nm, high penetration depth in tissue) with the superior spatial resolution of four-photon microscopy. The result would be nothing less than a true paradigm shift in multiphoton microscopy. The key to tackle this highly ambitious task lies in the design of molecules that combine two mechanistically entangled two-photon processes (4for2) for the generation of a fluorescence output. This is possible by merging two-photon absorption, two-photon FRET-induced photoisomerization, and negative photochromism. Purposefully designed switchable fluorophores, that unify these photophysical assets, will be developed and their performance will be critically validated in a multi-angle spectroscopic work-flow, including the demonstration in application-relevant biological environments.

Value-Aware Artificial Intelligence (VALAWAI)	By Value-Aware AI we mean AI that includes a component performing the same function as human moral consciousness, namely the capacity to acquire and maintain a value system, use this value system to decide whether certain actions are morally acceptable and be aware of the value systems of its users so as to understand the intent and motivation of their actions and to properly and correctly engage with them. The VALAWAI project will develop a toolbox to build Value-Aware AI resting on two pillars both grounded in science: An architecture for consciousness inspired by the Global Neuronal Workspace model developed on the basis of neurophysiological evidence and psychological data, and a foundational framework for moral decision-making based on psychology, social cognition and social brain science. The project will demonstrate the utility of Value-Aware AI in three application areas for which a moral dimension urgently needs to be included: (i) social media, where we see many negative side effects such as disinformation, polarisation, and the instigation of asocial and immoral behavior, (ii) social robots, which are designed to be helpful or influence human behavior in positive ways but potentially enable manipulation, deceit and harmful behavior, and (iii) medical protocols, where VALAWAI tries to ensure medical decision making is value aligned. The project contributes to the general goal of making EU-based AI more competitive by being more reliable, robust, ethically-guided, explainable and hence trustworthy. It does not make new proposals for guidelines and regulations (for which there is already considerable effort) but advances the state of the art in core AI technology so that ethics is embedded inside applications making them grounded in universal, European and personal values.	awareness technology, values, moral judgment, norms, information integration, computational reflection, meta-level representation, moral agency, moral cognition, intentionality attribution	AGENCIA ESTATAL CONSEJO SUPERIOR DE INVESTIGACIONES CIENTIFICAS	FUNDACIO INSTITUT HOSPITAL DEL MAR D INVESTIGACIONS MEDIQUES, FONDAZIONE ISTITUTO ITALIANO DI TECNOLOGIA, UNIVERSITEIT GENT, SONY EUROPE BV, STUDIO STELLUTI	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101070930/program/43108390/details	
ELectrOlysis of BIOmass (ELOBIO)	The ELOBIO consortium aims at advancing biomass electrolysis as a novel technological mean of green H2 production. ELOBIO will demonstrate that electrocatalytic oxidation of biomass-derived molecules offers the possibility to simultaneously reduce the energy cost and improve the chemical value of H2 production compared to the current water splitting technology. ELOBIO targets the development of low-temperature functional electrolysers capable of a large-scale production of H2 and value-added decarbonized chemicals, originating from the cellulosic biomass renewable exploitation. The project will design, build-up, test and improve a lab-scale prototype electrolysis cell at TRL4 involving a selective electrocatalytic cathode for the hydrogen evolution reaction and an electrocatalytic anode capable of selectively oxidizing biomass-derived compounds. Aldose-type sugars and furanic compounds were selected as model biomass for the validation of the concept. These molecules will be selectively converted to value-added chemicals which can be valorised in various sustainable chemical processes such as the production of biopolymers. Furthermore, several emerging technologies rely on electrolysis assisted with an additional renewable source of energy (ultrasound, magnetic field) or coupled with the concept of electrochemical promotion of catalysis will be explored to further enhance the energy efficiency of the green hydrogen electrolytic production. The technological advancements achieved in ELOBIO will scrupulously follow the EU recommendations on critical material avoidance, circularity and decarbonation objectives. A precise and detailed social life cycle will allow to pinpoint and reduce the sources of negative social, environmental and economic impacts of the proposed technology and thus improve its sustainability.

Material and digital traceability for the certification of critical raw materials (MaDiTraCe)	MaDiTraCe’s main goal is to enlarge and integrate the portfolio of technological solutions reinforcing the reliability of critical raw material (CRM) tracking and the transparency of complex supply chains. The project aims to develop and test independent digital and geo-based approaches for CRM traceability and to integrate them with a generic certification scheme for CRMs throughout mineral supply chains from the mine to the manufactured and recycled products. The project intends to increase the TRL of experimental or largely untested methods in both domains, digital and material sciences. A special attention will be payed to the complexity of mineral supply chains with points of material aggregation and of transformation (processing, refining…) including circular economy (recycling). This methodology will enable downstream industrials to prove the reliability of their sustainability claims, complying with regulation in force (notably EU Battery regulation, German Supply Chain Act) and anticipating implementation of regulation to come (EU Directive on Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence). MaDiTraCe’s fundament is a strong stakeholder process (WP1) with upstream and downstream industrials from mining to manufacturing industry and large networks involved via the consortia (EIT-RM) and clusters (ISMC) participating in the project. Continuous interaction with this industrial and policy-oriented stakeholder community on the traceability technology (WP2 and WP3) and the certification schemes (WP4) developed in the project will ensure to stay in line with industrial needs and expectations with respect to regulatory compliance. It will also facilitate implementation and exploitation (WP5) of the project outcomes.	critical raw materials; traceability; sourcing; certification; digital material passport	BUREAU DE RECHERCHES GEOLOGIQUES ET MINIERES	DMT GmbH & CO.

Strong-coupling-enhanced nanoparticle array organic light emitting diode (SCOLED)	We propose a radical new solution to the problem of increasing the efficiency of organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) based on modifying the light-matter coupling by nanostructures. All previous attempts to increase the efficiency of OLEDs to be competitive with commercial inorganic LEDs have failed. If successful, our new vision for strongly coupled organic light-emitting diodes (SCOLEDs) will bypass the existing technological bottleneck. OLEDs can be fabricated from earth-abundant non-toxic materials using energy-efficient processes, in stark contrast to the present market-leading inorganic LEDs. However, despite their much lower environmental impact, the widespread deployment of OLEDs has been blocked by their limited efficiency. To achieve the required step-change in efficiency, plasmonic nano-particle arrays will be used to enhance the coupling between light and matter within OLEDs. Our objectives are to enhance OLED efficiency to a level competitive with inorganic LEDs, and at the same time to adjust the periodicity, size and shape of the nanoparticles to control the color, polarization and directional distribution of the emitted light. Analytic theory, numerical simulations and nanofabrication will be combined with optical and electronic characterization across an interdisciplinary team with expertise ranging from materials science and electronics to photonics and quantum physics, including world-leading proficiency in nanoparticle arrays and strong light-matter coupling. Our ambitious target is the proof-of-principle demonstration of an OLED with more than 50% external quantum efficiency and tailorable control of the properties of the emitted light. SCOLEDs offer the prospect of a breakthrough technology that will dramatically reduce the environmental impact of LED technology in lighting and display applications, and will widen the palette of OLED applications to new and emerging areas such as electronic vehicles, augmented reality and urban agriculture.	organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs), nanoplasmonics, nanophotonics, nanoparticle arrays, strong light-matter coupling, exciton-polaritons, light management, spectral shaping	AALTO KORKEAKOULUSAATIO SR	TURUN YLIOPISTO, TECHNISCHE UNIVERSITEIT EINDHOVEN, UNIVERSIDAD AUTONOMA DE MADRID	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101098813/program/43108390/details	
group-IV LASer and deTectors on Si-TEchnology Platform (LASTSTEP)	Photonics plays a key role in many applications, such as a detection of environmental or toxic gases, analyses of food or health-related products. Those applications depend on the development of highly advanced photonic components working in the mid-infrared (MIR) wavelength range. These components have always been difficult and expensive to make, as they are not compatible with standard microelectronic or photonic fabrication processes. LASTSTEP ambitions to address this issue by developing the world-first all-Group-IV photonic platform using silicon-germanium-tin alloys (SiGeSn). Focusing on the MIR 2-5 µm region essential for sensing of chemical species, the project aims to ensure a wide scale adoption of the developed technology by offering a fully monolithic solution compatible with standard state-of-the-art 200mm CMOS manufacturing processes. The approach will enable cost-effective solutions for sensing, but also for autonomous navigation or consumer products. To achieve this objective, LASTSTEP gathers a world class consortium composed of 3 academic partners, 2 RTOs and 3 industrials. The partners are: -leaders of a CMOS compatible technology for growth and processing of GeSn direct bandgap alloys in an industry-relevant environment - two SMEs well-established on the markets of gas and liquid sensing - world leading PIC design and test-house company to ensure further exploitation of results. LASTSTEP will develop four prototypes based on the fully-group-IV photonic platform for two use-cases. Prototypes will first be assembled from discrete components, then integrated on PICs. LASTSTEP aims to secure for Europe an outstanding position in development and economic exploitation of Si photonics, thereby anticipating maximal return on investment for the EU society. LASTSTEP will bring the decisive further development of Si photonics into a technologically mature MIR platform ready for innovations in the communications, sensing, health, food and safety sector.

5G+ evoluTion to mutioRbitAl multibaNd neTwORks (TRANTOR)	5G mobile networks will be soon fully available, handling all types of applications and providing services to massive number of users. In this complex and dynamic network ecosystem, an optimized end-to-end satellite support is key to manage requirements imposed by multiple vertical industries requiring full global connectivity. The European space sector acknowledged this as a key opportunity to expand its business towards the massive deployment of broadband services, what resulted in standardization efforts to adapt 5G to satellite needs. In this context, the aim of TRANTOR is to perform a significant step forward by paving the path for the 5G NTN evolution towards 6G. To do so, TRANTOR targets the in-orbit validation of a complete satellite value chain involving an automated management of satellite resources across multiple bands, satellites, and orbits, and a converged radio access network. Specifically, at the ground segment, TRANTOR targets the development of novel satellite network management solutions, fully integrated in the 3GPP management framework, which allow the significant scaling up of heterogeneous satellite traffic demands and capacities in a cost-effective, highly dynamic, band and orbit agnostic manner. AI governance will be a main pillar here enabling real time radio resource management across multiple satellite systems for efficiently and trustworthy addressing satellite client needs. In parallel, in the user segment, TRANTOR aims to radically increase the flexibility of access architecture by enabling pre-6G non-terrestrial multi-connectivity. It will be supported by the design of a multi-orbit and multi-band antenna for satellite UEs as well as by the development of gNB and UE 5G NTN equipment able to attend the multi-connectivity needs. Finally, TRANTOR aims to introduce security mechanisms to provide resilience to all types of cyber-threads, specially those emerging from the integrated management and multi-connectivity framework proposed.	satellite communications, ground segment, multiorbit, multiband, multitrp	CENTRE TECNOLOGIC DE TELECOMUNICACIONS DE CATALUNYA	FRAUNHOFER GESELLSCHAFT ZUR FORDERUNG DER ANGEWANDTEN FORSCHUNG EV, HISPASAT SA, SOFTWARE RADIO SYSTEMS LIMITED, INSTER TECNOLOGIA Y COMUNICACIONESSA, CONSIGLIO NAZIONALE DELLE RICERCHE, INDRA SISTEMAS SA, UNIVERSITE DU LUXEMBOURG	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101081983/program/43108390/details	
BIOcomposites in smart plastic transformation processes to pave the way for the large-scale UPTAKE of sustainable bio-based products (BIO-UPTAKE)	The general objective of Bio-Uptake project is to ensure a sustainable uptake (increase the use in a 39%) of bioplastic composites through boosting a twin green and digital transformation in the European manufacturing industry. In particular, Bio-Uptake solution will focus scientific and technology efforts on developing flexible manufacturing processes to produce biobased end-products for the construction, medical and packaging sectors based on the combination of intermediate formats made of natural and/or biobased synthetic fibres reinforced with biopolymers, which are easily adaptable to new market demands. The novel approach on which Bio-Uptake project relies is based on modularity or pre-fabrication: a smart combination of intermediate formats (organosheets, tapes and pellets) into a final end-product which allows to overcome the current technical and environmental limitations to meet the demanding requirements of a specific sector/application where a single biobased material doesn?t. Thus, the synergistic potential of composite materials will pave the way for the integration and uptake of bio-based materials in mass customised manufacturing (manufacturing as a service). Three disruptive manufacturing processes (based on conformal technologies) will be developed within Bio-Uptake focused on the plastics manufacturing sector, which is on the centrality of a variety of value chains, and being demonstrated in 3 demo cases (bathroom ceiling cabinet, feet orthosis and garbage container lid). Sustainability criteria will be applied since the design phase to reach circularity by design, obtaining products with more than 75% biobased content and decreasing GHG up to 33%. Bio-Uptake solution does not request large investment in complex equipment too. Bio-Uptake consortium is formed by 13 interdisciplinar and complementary partners (6 industries, 4 RTOs, 1 academia and 2 Other organizations). The overall budget is 5,994,886 Euros.

Comprehensive, fast, user-friendly and thoroughly validated open-source energy system planning framework (Mopo)	The overall objective of Mopo is to develop a validated, user-friendly, feature-rich, innovative and well-performing energy system modelling toolset to serve public authorities, network operators, industry and academia to plan sustainable and resilient energy systems in a cost-effective manner. Mopo will include 1) component tools to produce all necessary energy system data; 2) system tool to manage data, scenarios and modelling workflows, to visualise data and to maintain datasets in multi-user environment without losing the track of changes; 3) planning tool to optimise all energy sectors in detail, including sector specific physics and highly flexible representation of temporal, spatial and technological aspects – user can choose how to model depending on the specific needs. The project is based on existing state-of-the-art tools including Spine Toolbox and SpineOpt. The advanced capabilities will be demonstrated through an industrial case (with detailed sector-specific physics) and Pan-European case (resilient pathways). The project will also produce an open access Pan-European dataset at hourly temporal resolution and high spatial resolution (NUTS2 capable). It can be fed into SpineOpt or used by other modelling groups. Mopo tools can recreate data at resolution required by the end-user – also for future climates. End-user requirements, feedback and tool validations will be important part of Mopo – the consortium includes representatives from all end-user categories. Partners will also have skills in user-interfaces, computational efficiency, data processing, code testing, community building and all aspects related to energy systems (technologies, sectors, resources). Mopo project aims to benefit 60% of network operators and public authorities within 2 years of the project end. The tools will be modular, which allows different organisations to adopt the parts that benefit their existing modelling systems.

Switching european food systems for a just, healthy and sustainable dietary transition through knowledge and innovation (SWITCH)	"The overarching goal of the SWITCH proposal is to improve understanding of knowledge, accessibility and facilitation gaps that limit present large scale adoption of sustainable and healthy diets among European citizens and to develop and demonstrate appropriate innovative solutions and tools to facilitate a just transition towards healthy and sustainable dietary behavior at all levels of the multi-actor food system in EU. The transition towards sustainable, safe, healthy and inclusive food systems, from farm to fork has become a key priority for EU policies, in line with the UN goals sustainable development goals (SDGs). The biggest challenge at present is represented by the limited knowledge of influence dietary choices which limits large scale adoption of healthy and sustainable diets. The SWITCH ambition is to accelerate the behavioral shift of European citizens towards more sustainable and healthy patterns, using Research and Innovation (R&I) as a driver to increase knowledge, accessibility and facilitation strategies at all level of the food systems, involving a multi-actor systemic approach and a co-creation strategy to delineate solutions fair to consumers that support virtuous behavior throughout the whole food chain. For a successful large scale adoption of healthy dietary behavior, all the actors of the food systems need to be engaged, connected and valorized. In pursuing its objectives the project aims to go beyond the present state-of-the-art addressing the most relevant points of the program topic ""Transition to healthy and sustainable dietary behaviour HORIZON-CL6-2021-FARM2FORK-01-15"""	Sustainable healthy diets, food systems, just transitions, dietary shift, diets, European citizens, policymakers, vulnerable groups, climate change, GHG emissions, LCA, social innovations, humanities	FONDAZIONE CENTRO EURO-MEDITERRANEOSUI CAMBIAMENTI CLIMATICI	UNIVERSITA DEGLI STUDI DELLA CAMPANIA LUIGI VANVITELLI, FUTURE FOOD INSTITUTE ETS, UNIVERSITA DEGLI STUDI DI NAPOLI FEDERICO II, LEIBNIZ-ZENTRUM FUER AGRARLANDSCHAFTSFORSCHUNG (ZALF) e.V., CHALMERS TEKNISKA HOGSKOLA AB, INTERNATIONALES INSTITUT FUER ANGEWANDTE SYSTEMANALYSE, WAGENINGEN UNIVERSITY, INSTITUT NATIONAL DE RECHERCHE POUR L'AGRICULTURE, L'ALIMENTATION ET L'ENVIRONNEMENT, UNIVERSIDAD POLITECNICA DE MADRID, ASOCIACION BC3 BASQUE CENTRE FOR CLIMATE CHANGE, POSTI S.R.L., RISE RESEARCH INSTITUTES OF SWEDEN AB, KUTXA FUNDAZIOA, BASQUE CULINARY CENTER FUNDAZIOA, AGENZIA REGIONALE PER L'ATTUAZIONEDEI PROGRAMMI REGIONALI IN CAMPO AGRICOLO E PER LO SVILUPPO RURALE (LAORE SARDEGNA), AGRO CAMERA AZIENDA SPECIALE DELLA CAMERA DI COMMERCIO, INDUSTRIA, ARTIGIANATO E AGRICOLTURA DI ROMA PER L'AGROALIMENTARE, VEREIN ZUR FORDERUNG EINER NACHHALTIGEN URBANEN KULTUR EV	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101060483/program/43108390/details	
Wireless deep BRAIN STimulation thrOugh engineeRed Multifunctinal nanomaterials (BRAINSTORM)	BRAINSTORM will introduce an innovative, scalable, wireless, multimodal nanoinvasive neuromodulation technology suitable for independent and switchable excitation and inhibition of deep brain neurons. BRAINSTORM breakthrough relies on novel smart anisotropic magnetic nanomaterials (SMNs) acting both as nanoscale ‘heaters’ and as ‘torquers’ by leveraging either hysteretic losses under kHz frequencies or transitions from vortex to in-plane magnetization under Hz frequencies. Intrinsic bimodal functionality that permits direct control of thermosensitive or mechanosenitive neurons, will be boosted by advanced polymer functionalization to transfer torques to electrical signals trough piezoelectric coating, and to enable transport and delivery of viral vectors to targeted neurons for genetic targeting with sensory channels. SMNs will also be steered to endogenous sensory channels relying on antibody targeting. Selected actuation of ion channels that respond to thermal or mechanical stimulus will permit selective activation or inhibition of targeted neuronal populations identifiable by magnetic resonance imaging. Advanced driving electronics will include to metamaterial solenoid coils for rapid frequency switch for control of ‘mechanical’ or ‘thermal’ functionality while focused ultrasound will facilitate non invasive delivery of SMNs in the targeted brain area. The ability of the BRAINSTORM platform to shape behaviour and demonstrate therapeutic potential by modulating the excitation/inhibition balance through thermal/mechanical/electrical modalities will be demonstrated in mouse models of Fragile X syndrome.

Circular fuel supply for air transport via negative emission HTL conversion (CIRCULAIR)	Achieving climate neutrality in Europe requires large volumes of truly sustainable fuels to provide long-term solutions for transport sectors where direct electrification is not viable. CIRCULAIR addresses this challenge with an integrated biofuel pathway that produces cost-effective aviation fuels and generates negative emissions. Key innovations of CIRCULAIR involve a close thermal coupling of hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) conversion, based on abundant and available agricultural residues and lignocellulosic crops, with exothermic wet oxidation of HTL process water. In this way, autothermal operation can be achieved, carbon is fully utilized, and the process water disposal problem of HTL is solved. In addition, CIRCULAIR develops innovative approaches to upgrade HTL biocrudes to jet fuel and accelerates the approval of HTL fuels for civil aviation. The biomass resource utilization is maximized by developing valorisation schemes for all relevant side streams along the process chain. In particular, acetic acid will be extracted from residual process waters and methanol will be synthesized from effluent gas streams and renewable hydrogen. Importantly, CIRCULAIR will close a knowledge gap regarding the utilization of fixed carbon in the HTL solids for carbon sequestration and soil amendment, i.e. for a negative contribution to the carbon balance. The targeted overall net-negative emission will be quantified based on life cycle analysis. Finally, techno- and socio-economic analyses will identify important benefits and trade-offs associated with the advanced biofuel process. In summary: CIRCULAIR will investigate and develop an innovative process for resource-efficient production of sustainable aviation biofuels alongside further marketable renewable chemicals and fuel products. The utilization of biomass feedstock that is abundant in agricultural environments ensures cost-efficiency, relevant scale and the potential to create net-negative carbon emissions.	jet fuel, negative emissions, hydrothermal liquefaction, sectorial coupling, renewable hydrogen	BAUHAUS LUFTFAHRT EV	AARHUS UNIVERSITET, AALBORG UNIVERSITET, UNIVERSITAET HOHENHEIM, UNIVERSIDAD COMPLUTENSE DE MADRID, TOPSOE AS, CIRCLIA NORDIC APS, ENI SPA, RISE RESEARCH INSTITUTES OF SWEDEN AB, L	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101083944/program/43108390/details	
Building REsilience against MEntal illness during ENDocrine-sensitive life stages (Re-MEND)	Mental illnesses represent a huge burden for society, the economy, and the aMental illnesses represent a huge burden for society, the economy, and the affected individuals. To significantly increase citizens? mental health, today?s symptom-based diagnoses need to be complemented by biological criteria accounting for individual and sex differences. Furthermore, early detection and prevention measures need to be improved. RE-MEND addresses the current gaps and challenges with an interdisciplinary approach by: i) focussing on four critical life stages in which an individual?s susceptibility to mental illness is strongly influenced by changes in endocrine signalling, including sex hormones, namely early life, puberty, peripartum, and transition into old age; ii) integrating data from large population-based longitudinal cohort studies allowing for discovery of risk and protective factors as well as biological patterns that influence mental states in the general population across these life stages; iii) complementing epidemiological with experimental studies to establish correlative and causative links leading to mechanistic understanding; iv) using advanced biostatistics as well as machine learning and artificial intelligence for data integration and biomarker and drug target discovery; v) combining the biological approaches with communication science studies to efficiently translate its results to societal impact. Ultemately, RE-MEND will result in: i) Significantly increased mental health literacy among stakeholders and citizens; ii) Validated biomarkers for assessing mental health state and its predisposition as well as more accurate diagnoses and personalised preventive and therapeutic measures; iii) Recommendations for early detection, better prevention, and drug design strategies to protect vulnerable individuals from mental illness in sensitive life stages; and iv) strategies on how these advances can be used to decrease stigma and increase prevention behaviour.

Hydrogen Optimized multi-fuel Propulsion system for clean and silEnt aircraft (HOPE)	The ICAO Post-COVID forecasts estimate a 2.4%-4.1% increase for a low to high revenue passenger-kilometres growth rate. Air traffic growth inevitably increases aviation's combustion and acoustic emissions, hence aggravating aviation's environmental impact locally and globally. HOPE will deliver an integrated aircraft propulsion system comprising two multi-fuel ultra-high bypass ratio (UHBR) turbofan engines, a fuel cell based auxiliary propulsion and power unit (FC-APPU) driving an aft boundary layer ingestion (BLI) propulsor based on tube-wing aircraft configuration. The HOPE system: 1)minimises the combustion and noise emissions during landing and takeoff (LTO), hence the impact on air quality and noise annoyance near airports, without the trade-off of cruise emissions; 2)retrofits the existing aircraft configuration, allowing the substantial emission reduction to be achieved within a short time; 3)de-risks the use of hydrogen solely in existing tube-wing aircraft configurations; 4)smoothens aviation’s energy transition through assessment and exploitation of several greener propulsion technologies at different maturity level. HOPE emission goals consist of LTO NOx: -50%, CO: -50%, soot: -80%, perceived noise: -20% (~3 dB per operation), and climate impact: -30%, compared to state-of-the-art technology in 2020 (A320neo). To this end, HOPE will: 1)Design an integrated aircraft propulsion system accommodating multi-fuel (kerosene/sustainable aviation fuel +hydrogen) UHBR turbofan engines, FC-APPU, and an aft BLI propulsor; 2)Explore the novel idea of combining a BLI propulsor with FC-APPU for zero-emission taxiing; 3)Model, experiment, and demonstrate for the first time a low emission multi-fuel combustion technology burning H2+kerosene/SAF for future UHBR turbofan engine; 4)Assess societal impact, environmental burden, and cost benefits of the reduced noise and emissions by HOPE technology; 5)Formulate policy and recommendations to introduce HOPE technology.

Future Lives with Oceans and Waters (FLOW)	Future Lives with Oceans and Waters (FLOW) will enable co-ownership, co-responsibility and co-implementation of the young generation to co-create effective, target-group oriented and actionable blueprints for stewardship assemblages featuring social interaction and engagement with sea and waters. In doing so, FLOW will contribute to the Restore our Oceans by 2030 Mission. The project's innovative design brings together diverse young people from all across Europe with an excellent, interdisciplinary research team. Our research is built along a chain of direct cooperation with young people via 1) the FLOW Youth advisory board, 2) the European network of youth-focused NGOs, 3) Experiential futures workshops with young people from seven regions across Europe and 4) Youth-stakeholder co-creation. FLOW will go beyond instrumental treatment of knowledge about the young generation 1) by a novel transdisciplinary research approach (‘inFLOW lens’) studying their expectations, engagements, and human-nature relationship with the seas and waters; 2) by bringing together policy-makers, researchers and other relevant stakeholders together with the youth and engaging them in co-creation of stewardship assemblages. Insights from FLOW will support shaping future policies. All stakeholders claim to represent the interests of young and future generations. FLOW develops a new approach of co-creating future policies that mitigates the risk of naively generalizing and amplifying statements of young people that are made amid, and despite of, vested interests and debates that are polarized between nature-connectedness, preservation and conservation on the one side and resource use, value creation and economic prosperity on the other side. To fully raise the potential that is embedded in FLOW's structure and generate scientifically-sound, un-biased and non-partisan insights, we base cooperation and co-creation with young people on scientific rigour, reflexivity and evidence assured.	youth engagement and mobilization, transdisciplinary research, human-nature relations, foresight, environmental psychology, sociology and philosophy, nature conservation management	STICHTING RADBOUD UNIVERSITEIT	FRAUNHOFER GESELLSCHAFT ZUR FORDERUNG DER ANGEWANDTEN FORSCHUNG EV, UNIVERSITETET I TROMSOE, VOLONTEUROPE	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101093928/program/43108390/details

Personalised pharmacometabolomic optimisation of treatment for hypertension (Hypermarker)	Hypertension, or high blood pressure (BP), is a serious medical condition, and the single biggest contributor to circulatory diseases which continue to dominate as the leading cause of death and morbidity across the EU. It accounts for almost 10 percent of all healthcare-related costs. Systolic hypertension leads to a broad variety of diseases with an immense impact on both patients and healthcare systems. HYPERMARKER will unleash the potential of pharmacometabolomics to provide a ‘smart’ prescription of antihypertensive therapy. Well-phenotyped cohorts from eleven European countries will provide metabolomic profiles and blood samples for pharmacometabolomic assessments to identify predictors of treatment response in hypertension using advanced AI and deep learning methods. Prediction models for individual treatment responses to antihypertensive medication will be clinically validated and refined through an innovative RCT across 4 sites in Europe. The result is a clinical decision support tool that will give clinicians the ability to make an informed selection of whether the patient they are treating will best respond to the use of angiotensin inhibition, calcium antagonists, beta-blockers, or a range of other existing drugs with evidence-based for BP control. To ensure sustainability, the project will also develop a framework for the uptake of this tool in routine care for patients with hypertension across Europe and beyond. HYPERMARKER will be implemented by a group of world-class scientists and clinicians from a diversity of disciplines who have collaborated multiple times and have a track record of leading key national and EU-funded initiatives to deliver high-impact results.

BAYesian Inference with FLEXible electronics for biomedical Applications (BAYFLEX)	The long term vision in BAYFLEX is to create a radically new technology that uses low cost, green organic electronics for probabilistic computing in order to allow continuous and private monitoring of bio-signals on flexible substrates. The vision of flexible green AI sensors with on chip classification extends well beyond biomedical devices and the democratization of health care, with the possibility to transform sensor data at the edge of large networks. To achieve our goal, BAYFLEX will demonstrate a patch using active physiological sensors based on organic materials that interface with the soft human body and that also includes classification circuits (~ 100 transistors) fabricated using Thin Organic Large Area Electronics (TOLAE) processes. These circuits use spiking neurons realized in Organic Thin Film Transistors (OTFTs) to transform the non-stationary electrical signals from the sensors into stochastic bit streams. Bayesian inference is then used to classify the data using circuits of cascaded Muller C-elements. Taking advantage of the unique properties of organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs), low transistor count dynamic Muller C-elements are targeted. The patch will be tested on a simple task using healthy humans. The project brings together an interdisciplinary consortium with expertise in modeling emerging devices, biologically inspired circuit design, experts in machine learning involving electrophysiological data (including an SME) and teams with expertise in OTFT and OECT fabrication. BAYFLEX targets dissemination to a variety of publics including: scientists via publications in (open access) high impact journals and conferences; industrials and end-users through an industrial advisory board, a workshop and demonstrations at targeted conferences; the general public with the creation of a transferable workshop for non-scientific communities and training the next generation of experts through specialized schools and workshops.

Ethical Design of Holography with Dense wireless Networks (HOLDEN)	Ubiquitous perception, by sensing of objects, subjects and gestures, is a pivotal challenge for future technology: it enables personalized services such as smart living, automated logistics or interaction through free-space gestures. However, it also challenges ethical and moral boundaries and threatens privacy. HOLDEN proposes a radically new approach to perception by concisely analysing ethical constraints and privacy risks while re-thinking RF-based sensing. We establish necessary conditions for privacy preserving and ethically compliant sensing and develop new paradigms respecting these constraints. For the first time ever, HOLDEN constitutes a concentrated effort to explore social aspects of RF-sensing to guide the technological advance and to derive technology for ethically and privacy compliant perception. Central to HOLDEN is the development of ethical and privacy constraints. We use these findings to derive privacy and ethically compliant concepts for RF-based perception. We will develop a system of distributed multi-antenna devices for simultaneous multi-target recognition and ubiquitous perception with unprecedented accuracy, which constitutes a radical paradigm shift from a technology-centric perspective to a privacy-centric one via privacy by design. HOLDEN achieves this goal along three high risk, complementary, and privacy-centric paths: Path 1: Continuous-space measurement points: Radio-based 3D vision by holographic image processing of RF wave-fronts. Path 2: Discrete-space measurement points: Advanced 3D beamforming for human-scale recognition and tracking through dense massive connected antenna arrays. Path 3: Signal processing and learning: High-dimensional tensor processing for the distinction of complex activities and motion from massive-dimensional RF data.

REAL TIME MOLECULAR IMAGER WITH UNSURPASSED RESOLUTION (RETIMAGER)	Over the last decades, Positron Emission Tomography (PET) has been firmly established as the predominant molecular imaging technique due to its unmatched sensitivity and capability to address many different metabolic processes. However, there is huge room for improvement, as current clinical PET scanners are limited to spatial resolutions higher than 2.5 mm and temporal resolutions longer than 5 seconds. This hampers applications of PET for preclinical research and clinical diagnosis in small tissues or lesions and precludes real-time reconstruction of metabolic images. RETIMAGER is a proposal for a molecular imaging system with a ten-fold spatial and temporal improvement on the reconstructed image with respect to current PET devices. This will not only boost the quantitative performance, but it will enable new applications in cardiology, vascular oncology, oncology, neurology, and other areas. We will achieve this milestone by developing smart radiation detectors with non-conventional geometries that combine the advantages of both pixelated and monolithic detectors, the two dominant and seemingly incompatible technologies employed in PET scanners. Our new scanner will provide 0.25 mm pixel resolvability with time frames as short as 0.01 sec. By aggregating these blocks in a unique gantry self-adapting to the geometry of the field-of-view, RETIMAGER will achieve an unprecedented increase in sensitivity and in in vivo real-time imaging with submillimeter resolution. We will pair it with high-throughput data processing and AI tools to assess with a single tracer both perfusion and metabolism in preclinical and clinical models. In the long run, RETIMAGER’s faster, lower dose, and less invasive molecular imaging technology will become a game-changer for understanding disease processes by unveiling new accurate image-based quantitative biomarkers, taking scientific and healthcare stakeholders a step closer to personalized precision medicine.

SCALABLE MULTI-CHIP QUANTUM ARCHITECTURES ENABLED BY CRYOGENIC WIRELESS / QUANTUM -COHERENT NETWORK-IN PACKAGE (QUADRATURE)	Today’s tremendous interdisciplinary effort towards building a quantum computer promises to tackle problems beyond reach of any classical computer. Although intermediate-scale quantum computers have been recently demonstrated to exceed the capability of the most powerful supercomputers, it is widely recognized that addressing any real-world problem will require upscaling quantum computers to thousands or even millions of qubits. This proposal focuses on the grand challenge of scalability in quantum computers, from a full-stack architectural standpoint, and enabled by communication networks operating within the quantum computing package at cryogenic temperatures. The QUADRATURE project hence aims to pioneer a new generation of scalable quantum computing architectures featuring distributed quantum cores (Qcores) interconnected via quantum-coherent qubit state transfer links and orchestrated via an integrated wireless interconnect. This novel architecture supports reconfigurability to serve massive flows of heterogeneous quantum algorithmic demands. The main objectives are (i) to experimentally prove the first micro-integrated all-RF qubit-state transfer link within a cryogenic tunable superconducting cavity waveguide in the microwave and THz frequency region for quantum-coherent frequency-multiplex and routing (ii) to achieve experimentally the transfer of classical data through wireless in-package links by integrated cryo-antennas and tranceivers (iii) to build protocols for a quantum-coherent integrated network enabling the exchange of qubits through the coordination of the quantum-coherent data plane and the wireless control plane (iv) to develop appropriate scalable architectural methods such as mapping, scheduling, and coordination approaches across multiple Qcores, and (v) to demonstrate the scalability of the approach via multi-scale design space optimization and for a set of quantum algorithm benchmarks, with at least 10x improvement in overall performance.

Social media for democracy – understanding the causal mechanisms of digital citizenship (SoMe4Dem)	Social media for democracy – understanding the causal mechanisms of digital citizenship (SoMe4Dem) Current diagnoses that democracy is in crisis at the beginning of the 21st century share a common argumentative reference point: the (implicit) reference to the dysfunctional constitution of the political public sphere which is currently undergoing structural change. The rise of social media platforms is considered as one of its main constituents. While social media make the public arena more open and thus more responsive, these platforms also lead to new mechanisms of fragmentation and exclusion, an erosion of norms in public debate and a loss of trust in traditional institutions. The project will reconsider the diagnoses of this crisis by (1) providing better empirical evidence for the impact of social media on society with respect to political debates, (2) understanding the main causal mechanisms of this impact and (3) developing tools that improve the capacity of social media to contribute to the functioning of the public arena in a liberal democracy, i.e., deliberation, legitimation and the self-perception of the democratic subject.

On-chip tomographic microscopy: a paraDIgm Shift for RevolUtionizing lab-on-a-chiP bioimaging technology (DISRUPT)	DISRUPT aims at revolutionising the field of biomedical imaging by developing a radically new lab-a-on-chip technology: integrated tomographic microscopy. This unprecedented technique will be enabled by pushing forward the science of on-chip wireless photonics and tomography, in combination with microfluidics and artificial intelligence (AI). The CMOS compatibility of this technology represents a paradigm shift as it assures the realization of tomographic microscopes that are dramatically cheaper, lighter, and smaller than current approaches. Moreover, the singular features of the proposed solution introduce key advantages in terms of resolution, sensitivity, throughput, parallelisation, and energy efficiency. To illustrate its potential, we will show that on-chip TPM can be used for cancer detection and the identification of infected cells. Developments related to fundamental nanoantenna and diffraction tomography science, nanophotonics, nanofabrication, microfluidics, AI and clinical validation will be undertaken by a consortium comprised by 2 SME, 1 HE, 1 Non-profit RO and 2 Cancer R&D Medical institutions, with complementary expertise, leaders in their respective markets and R&D fields. This novel device is suited for many applications, such as early cancer diagnosis, cell characterisation, research on cancer and infectious diseases, immunocyte phenotyping, stem cell multipotency identification, tissue pathology, haematopathology, and analysis of infected cells. Its intrinsic mass-producible, compact, low-cost, mechanically robust, and energy-efficient feature makes this technology a future innovation driver for new developments in many biomedical application fields, and offers an alternative toolset addressing some of the emerging needs of microscopic analysis and diagnostics in low-resource settings, telemedicine applications and point-of-care, having a potentially huge societal impact fostering early diagnosis of cancer and other diseases and infections.

THE CARE WAVE AND THE FUTURE OF THE BABY BOOMERS AND THEIR CHILDREN (BB-Future)	The baby boomers are in the process of retiring. Most are between 60 and 65 when they retire and almost 80% self-assess their health as good. A huge number of research projects has analyzed retirement decisions and the impact of this “pension wave” on the transformation of pension systems in the ageing societies in Europe and elsewhere. There is no lack of pension finance projections and policy advice for pension reforms and their socio-economic effects, including active ageing and the role of elder citizens in transforming our economies into “silver economies”. Much less is known about the second great transformation that will follow the pension wave. In the mid2030s, the health of the baby boomers will have deteriorated and many in these large cohorts will be in need of formal and/or informal long-term care. This “care wave” will transform two generations: the baby boomers in need of care and their children who may supply care. It will have significant implications for labour supply, especially for women, saving behaviour, and therefore for productivity, economic growth and its inclusiveness.

Neuromorphic computing Enabled by Heavily doped semiconductor Optics (NEHO)	NEHO will develop a novel photonic integrated circuit platform that enables ultrafast and low-energy consumption neuromorphic information processes by means of a newly developed nonlinear photon-plasmon semiconductor technology at mid-infrared wavelengths (8-12 μm). NEHO vision will be achieved by unconventional use of semiconductors to optimize and control plasmonic effects that will provide the optical nonlinearity required to implement the functionalities of an artificial neuron. NEHO's optical neuron will be the building block for the realization of ultrafast optical neural networks. We will combine the flexibility of field-effect devices realized on semiconductors with the nanoscale nature of plasmonic processes so to enable the reconfigurability of the nonlinear optical coefficient at each node of the network, simply obtained by controlling DC electric potential levels. At the heart of NEHO is the idea of exploiting the rich electron dynamics of semiconductors. Doped semiconductors undergo an interesting transition from the size-quantization regime to the classical regime of plasmon oscillations. This transition region can exhibit strong nonlocal and nonlinear optical response due to a large variety of electron-electron interactions. The decrease in electron density induced on the semiconductor surface by an external bias can be used to modulate the nonlinear response strength. This unprecedented feature will be used to leverage the hardware implementation of a neural network into the development of new machine learning optimization techniques, including the optimization of the nonlinear activation function to different tasks. This extra degree of freedom will offer tremendous benefits for a large variety of machine learning applications.	optical neural networks, hybrid photonics-plasmonics, reconfigurable optical nonlinearity, semiconductor plasmonics, hydrodynamic nonlinearity	FONDAZIONE ISTITUTO ITALIANO DI TECNOLOGIA	LUDWIG-MAXIMILIANS-UNIVERSITAET MUENCHEN, UNIVERSITEIT GENT, CONSIGLIO NAZIONALE DELLE RICERCHE, CENTRE NATIONAL DE LA RECHERCHE SCIENTIFIQUE CNRS	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101046329/program/43108390/details	
3D Biofabricated high-perfoRmance dna-carbon nanotube dIgital electroniCKS (3D-BRICKS)	Silicon-based CMOS technology is approaching its performance limits, but the demand for more powerful computers — driven by rapid advances in applications such as the Internet of Things, big data and artificial intelligence (AI) — remains. The discovery of various nanomaterials provides new opportunities to further develop information processing technology. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have, in particular, demonstrated excellent properties as a channel material in transistors. Computers based on CNT field-effect transistors (FETs) have been theoretically predicted to provide a power-performance improvement of ten times over computers based on Si-CMOS technology. However, the fabrication of high-performance CNT-nanoelectronics, and the realization of the full potential of CNTs, is highly challenging. A technological revolution would be a reliable approach to fabricate a new family of CNT-based devices that could enable aligned arrangement of the nanotubes avoiding the critical steps related to nanolithography. In particular, biofabrication using DNA-templated CNT arrays FETs has been demonstrated to further scale the alignment of CNTs within the FETs well beyond standard lithographic feasibility. 3D-BRICKS will raise this concept of integrated self-assembly CNT-nanocircuits to a completely new level by moving towards the third dimension. Indeed, the versatility of DNA nanotechnology will be the root for conceiving 3-dimensional (3D) CNT-FETs and CNT-nonvolatile memories. DNA nanotechnology will also enable to complement the CNT deposition with metallic connections, hence realizing a working circuit. This will reduce the foot-print of the final device while enhancing its efficiency, hence providing a breakthrough solution to realize the next-generation nanoelectronics. Our approach will enable the production of scalable biotemplated electronics that can be extended to multiple applications such as metamaterials, sensors, optoelectronics, and others.	nanoelectronics; DNA nanotechnology; carbon nanotubes;	FONDAZIONE ISTITUTO ITALIANO DI TECNOLOGIA	UNIVERSITAET LEIPZIG, UNIVERSITAET HAMBURG, UNIVERSITEIT ANTWERPEN, KARLSRUHER INSTITUT FUER TECHNOLOGIE, KERR S.R.L, FUNDACIO INSTITUT CATALA DE NANOCIENCIA I NANOTECNOLOGIA, CNT INNOVATION	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101099125/program/43108390/details	
BABOTS: The design and control of small swarming biological animal robots (BABOTS)	We aim to establish a fundamentally new technology of Biological Animal roBots (BABots), consisting of small animals with a genetically modified nervous system, enabling the execution of a desired repertoire of behaviors beyond their natural abilities. We will implement the first BABot system in C. elegans, a 1 mm long nematode worm. These worms will be programmed to act as a collective, and to detect, locate and attack invading pathogens in an agricultural setting. Being 100% biological, BABots are highly compatible with the natural environment, self-producible, and fully degradable. They will also be agile and highly sensitive to surrounding signals. To control BABot behavior, we will genetically insert specific new synaptic connections and synthetic gene circuits in C. elegans to produce artificial aggregation, dynamic sensorimotor switching and other functional building blocks. To ensure a safe and controlled deployment, we will genetically implement a multi-layered biocontainment apparatus. To gain tighter control over the BABot collective behavior, we will exploit heterogeneity in the population, blending, for example, leader and follower BABots, based on their differential access to information. The science behind this innovative technology includes a synthetic neurobiological approach to modifying individual worm behavior, the study of collective behavior in engineered worms, and the development of a theory of heterogeneity-based swarm control. We also dedicate a substantial effort to establish a firm and effective safety, ethical and regulatory framework, under which current and future BABots can be developed. This project will generate a radically new approach to bio-robotics that could contribute to precision agriculture, industry and medicine. Improving over a previous proposal, we significantly enhanced (i) the methodology, (ii) the safety and ethical aspects, and (iii) the demonstration and exploitation by implementation in an agricultural setting.

Nano electro-optomechanical programmable integrated circuits (NEUROPIC)	NEUROPIC will design, build, measure, and explore a novel programmable photonic chip architecture with transformational impact potential on photonics for data centers, autonomous vehicles, quantum information processors, and much more. We will explore and pioneer programmability of large-scale photonic circuits using nanoelectromechanical technologies, which benefit from ultralow power consumption, compact footprint, and potentially faster operation than existing approaches. Building on very recent breakthroughs from the consortium partners, the nanotechnology is now in place to begin the exploration of programmable photonic chips scaled to thousands of programmable nodes. The main objectives range from sustainable and high-performance silicon nanomachining over establishing a scalable platform for ultralow-power nanoelectromechanical programmable silicon photonics to massively parallel optical interconnects. Our final goal is to use the network of independent and fully controllable nodes for neuromorphic computing to quantify the role of complexity for artificial intelligence. The objectives present a strong mutual synergy, scientific impact, and sustainability and set the foundations for four highly attractive business cases with complementary profiles in terms of risk and market size. NEUROPIC is therefore designed to address the fundamental scientific and technological questions of today whose answers hold potential for very large commercial impact in the future. Our quest comes with a new set of challenges and calls for a radically new approach to photonics. NEUROPIC unites some of the world’s leading researchers and companies in nanotechnology, photonics, advanced manufacturing, and complex systems in a risky and highly interdisciplinary research project with the ambition of founding a new paradigm of programmable silicon photonics.	complex photonics, silicon nanotechnology, neuromorphic computing	AGENCIA ESTATAL CONSEJO SUPERIOR DE INVESTIGACIONES CIENTIFICAS	DANMARKS TEKNISKE UNIVERSITET, BEAMFOX TECHNOLOGIES APS, UNIVERSITY COLLEGE CORK, FICONTEC SERVICE GMBH, FUNDACIO INSTITUT CATALA DE NANOCIENCIA I NANOTECNOLOGIA	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101098961/program/43108390/details	
Wellbeing, inclusion, sustainability and the economy (WISE Horizons)	WISE Horizons will inform and accelerate the transition to a new economic paradigm with wellbeing, inclusion and sustainability at its core. The project will create a state-of-the-art theoretical framework which synthesises the current post-growth initiatives through a novel and open access WISE accounting framework. The framework will define core terms and link to Beyond-GDP metrics, satellite accounts, policy strategies and the current generation of economic and integrated models. It will link to European policy strategies such as the Net-zero targets, the Circular Economy transition and Sustainable Competitiveness. With partners in Africa, the US and China it will also globally assess the current and new economic paradigms from the perspective of Sustainable Developments Goals. Any transition will result in trade-offs and synergies between different elements of a new economy such as wellbeing, inclusion and sustainability. These will be empirically analysed and used to inform policy and society about the choices that will shape the future up to 2050. The historical empirical analyses will use the WISE database and thematic/integrated models that address the core questions and policies of the post-growth society will be created by leading experts/institutes in the field of Beyond-GDP, inequality, sustainability and post-growth economics. To maximise the impact of the project, the WISE stakeholder Platform, which is a “network of networks” will be created and the groups involved in the WISE Platform will be engaged in communication, dissemination and exploitation. The empirical research involved in this project will be done in a novel co-creative approach involving stakeholders in 5 co-creation labs/workshops. Special attention is given to individuals that are negatively affected by the transformation. An ambitious communication strategy will facilitate a new public debate away from the standard economic paradigm and towards a new paradigm fit for the future.

Development of an In-Vivo Brillouin Microscope (with application to Protein Aggregation-based Pathologies) (IVBM-4PAP)	The role and importance of mechanical properties of cells and tissues in cellular function, development and disease has widely been acknowledged, however standard techniques currently used to assess them exhibit intrinsic limitations (invasive, lack of 3D capability and of sub-cellular resolution). Recently, Brillouin Microscopy (BM), a type of optical elastography, has emerged as a non-destructive, label- and contact-free method that can probe the viscoelastic properties of biological samples with diffraction-limited resolution in 3D. This led to increased attention amongst the biological and medical research communities. However, due to the long acquisition time (hours), this novel technique has been applied only to fixed samples. One important open challenge is to use this approach to follow the mechano-biological processes in living cells and in real time.

A synaptic mechanogenetic technology to repair brain connectivity (SynMech)	We aim to develop a mechanogenetic technology to regulate functional connectivity of neural circuits, and show how it can be harnessed for therapeutic purposes in high-prevalence treatment-resistant brain disorders. Mechanogenetics is an emerging field of health science that attempts to regulate neural networks by combining the advantages of optogenetics with those of magneto-mechanical stimulations; like optogenetics, it relies on targeted actuators to achieve circuit specificity, while exploiting magnetic fields to remotely stimulate the brain. Yet, despite solid theoretical foundations and encouraging experimental results, we are to date unable to repair a dysfunctional brain using mechanogenetics due to technological barriers in spatial resolution and in vivo implementation. We propose an innovative solution based on functionalized biocompatible magnetic nanoparticles and bioengineered synaptic mechanosensors that synergistically integrate at specific synaptic connections to bidirectionally regulate brain circuit connectivity in response to focused magnetic fields of different frequencies delivered via high-permeability transcranial magnetic stimulators. By hijacking the signaling pathways of synaptic mechanosensors, we aim to promote a normalization of neural circuit activity that outlasts the therapeutic intervention. We will assess the capacity of the synaptic mechanogenetic toolkit to promote and depress network activity in mouse models of stroke and epilepsy. To achieve this ambitious goal, we have gathered an interdisciplinary consortium going from material scientists and electronic experts to physiologists and clinicians. Our approach, based on magnetic fields that penetrate brain tissue unimpeded, is predicted to go beyond current therapeutic paradigms because it does not require implantation of invasive devices, and at the same time, promises to achieve subcellular resolution for repairing connectivity defects that underlie most brain disorders.

Intelligent design of adenovirus vectors (iAds) (iAds)	Advanced therapies, and in particular gene therapies, hold great potential for treating diseases for which few options exist. Efficient gene transfer is inherently and intransigently linked to vector efficacy. Partially due to the lack of suitable delivery systems for particular applications, the success of too many gene therapies is limited. Over the last two decades, immense progress has been made in the development of viral vectors. Importantly, this progress has also identified vector characteristics and biological factors that decrease efficacy. While limited efficacy is relevant for all vector platforms, it is more pressing in the case of adenoviruses because they have so much potential. In some cases, host responses and imperfect targeting have stunted adenovirus vector development for therapies that require long-term transgene expression. Our multi-faceted consortium proposes an innovative approach to overcome these limitations and to construct a pathway for developing improved vectors for clinical gene transfer. By synergising French, Dutch, British, Spanish and Swedish expertise in structural biology, receptor engagement, neurobiology, cardiobiology, and bioprocessing, we will create in silico designed intelligent adenovirus vectors (iAds). Our disruptive concept abandons the classical approach of developing vectors from naturally occurring adenoviruses. Instead, a proprietorial adenovirus type will be serially stripped of unwanted elements to create a bank of iAds, which will then be engineered for heart- and brain-specific targeting. Our consortium blends academic ingenuity and SME/pharma manufacturing that will allow seamless clinical translation. With the support of the EIC Programme, our ground-breaking approach should revolutionise gene transfer and generate solutions in areas of unmet medical need via a platform that exploits the full potential of viral vectors.

Plankton-like Protocells for Artificial Photosynthesis Targeting Carbon-neutral Energy Vectors (PLANKT-ON)	While mature solar technologies (i.e. photovoltaics, photo-electrochemical cells) cannot simultaneously address the multi-faceted future energy challenge, PLANKT-ON aims to develop a disruptive net-zero emissions technology to both address the global energy demand and reoxygenation of our planet. Inspired by Nature, we propose to assemble the first synthetic plankton-like protocells that autonomously utilise light, water, and CO2 to produce O2 and formate, as a green H2 vector. To this aim, the plankton-like protocells will be shaped as containers of two synergic subdomains mimicking the natural plastids and the CO2-enzyme organelles. The artificial plastid (1st type proto-organelle) will utilise light to oxidise H2O to O2 and reduce a methyl viologen (MV) cofactor, this latter will feed the CO2-rich proto-organelle to selectively produce formate by a cascade enzymatic reaction. We are expecting that this original bio-inspired strategy will open a route to sustainable solar hydrogen. The long term impact is envisaged for scientific innovation in groundbreaking solar-technology, going beyond the conventional photoelectrochemical cabled asset, and readily exploitable for empowering the EU vision for “Smart Buildings as Micro-Energy Hubs” in the world. Fundamental Research advances will be monitored by PLANKT-ON innovation radar activities, protected by our IP policy and disseminated to reach the expected stakeholders and the general public. Multidisciplinary collaboration among the 6 partners, from 4 EU countries, 5 research centres, and 1 technology-based company, underpins the project activities that will target the EU mission. PLANKT-ON counts on the valuable experience of its Scientific Advisory Committee where international renowned scientists from Princeton (USA), Berkeley (USA), Tokyo (Japan) and EPFL-Lausanne (Switzerland) will contribute to the results evaluation and benchmarking in the field of light management, photo-catalysis and green H2 transport.

High Q factOr MiniaturizEd low Mass (Accoustic) filters for highly DEmanding space applications (HOMEMADE)	The HOMEMADE project falls directly into the scope of the HORIZON EUROPE policy: “To reduce the dependence on critical technologies and capabilities from outside Europe for future space applications”. We target a fast growing market which integrates communication satellites in 5G networks that will reduce digital divide by meeting latent demand for digital broadband. The project aims at developing a truly new Surface Acoustic Wave(SAW) filter technology not yet available to space industry. This innovation based on Piezo-On-Insulator (POI) wafers already produced for Smart phone industry is not accessible to space industry due to market size and its own high reliability specificities. Compared to existing technologies, POI-based SAW filters enable high integration, temperature stability, thermal management, low insertion loss and high rejection with various bandwidths in L- and S-band frequencies, replacing leaky waves on usual piezoelectric substrates by real guided waves on Silicon-based wafers. This project will deliver, as first pillar, POI-based SAW filters for space industry up to a TRL7 addressing all volume demands, in line with Geosynchronous Earth Orbiting satellites to Low Earth Orbiting satellite constellations. The supply chain for key items such as POI wafer supply, to front-end and back-end process is based in Europe. The high demand of innovation yielding reduced mass in satellites especially for new growing markets within a limited access time, has pushed to develop in HOMEMADE a second pillar that will deliver disruptive POI based SAW filters able to compete with bulky mechanical filters. The value chain includes European supplier of specific acoustic passive SOI-FREC as part of the SOITEC group with space integrator and technology supplier TAS, UCL and SME INC both world leaders in the field POI based material and device optimization, and finally ALT European centre of excellence for space reliability of high complexity active and passive components.

building vascular networks and Blood-Brain-Barriers through a Biomimetic manufacturing Technology for the fabrication of Human tissues and ORgans (THOR)	Tenths of millions of people with organ failures or suffering from degenerative diseases are waiting for a novel cellular therapy or for a transplant of a donor compatible organ and the immense majority of these patients will die before receiving the tissue or organ they need. Despite the significant advances in tissue engineering, not a single artificial tissue has been used to replace a part of an organ, with the exception of simple or avascular tissues like skin or cartilage. THOR proposes the development of a revolutionary tissue engineering technology, capable to produce any type of human tissue for organ repair or replacement in case of illness, trauma or degenerative diseases. Patient-tailored tissues will be fabricated by pools of bioinspired mini-robots in fully automated production plants, using the breakthrough incremental technologies of the THOR project: self-assembling molecules inspired to the extracellular matrix; self-assembling solid and hollow polymeric fibers; materials functionalization using photoactivable crosslinkers; cutting-edge mini robots to wave 3D self-assembling structures with factors and cells with micrometric precision. THOR tissue arises from high-resolution 3D spatial positioning of self-assembling structures, angiogenic factors and relevant cell lineages, reprogrammed and expanded in a dedicated bioreactor under controlled conditions. Our long-term vision encompasses (1) the establishment of a Tissue Engineering industry for personalized organ repair, producing any type of well vascularized and fully functioning tissues and (2) the maintenance of such tissues alive for long periods of time, for an easy transportation to hospitals and clinics, even far from the big cities. THOR will foster the rise of a new industry and of a new biomedical field, while cadaveric donors' transplants will not be necessary.	vascular, biohybrid, biofunctionalization, stem cells, human, loom, spider, organoculture, 3D substitutes, in vitro, self-assembly	UNIVERSIDAD POLITECNICA DE MADRID	UNIVERSITAETSKLINIKUM FREIBURG, ELVESYS, UNIVERSITA DEGLI STUDI DELLA CAMPANIA LUIGI VANVITELLI, BIOACTIVE SURFACES SL	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101099719/program/43108390/details	
ZERo-carbon building enabling Adaptive opaque Facade technology (ZERAF)	Building market demands high indoor environmental quality but is under the pressure of energy price volatility, European policies, targeting a carbon neutral building stock by 2050, and local building regulations. A drastic carbon footprint reduction on the EU building stock is only possible with: (i) a strong reduction of heating and cooling energy demand and (ii) the limitation of the embodied environmental impacts of building materials. We propose a disruptive facade concept, the ZERo-carbon building enabler Adaptive opaque Facade (ZERAF), to get a huge decrease in the operational energy demand, while reducing the environmental impact of new and existing buildings through novel materials. ZERAF concept enables shifting the opaque building façade systems from being static thermal barriers to thermal modulators. The disruptive configurations of opaque façade technology and the use of novel materials (smart Shape Memory Alloys, and new generation bio-based polyurethanes) enable such a dynamic thermal control. Moreover, ZERAF minimizes the number of primary sources (in terms of volume and diversity) and then of the embodied carbon. ZERAF radically reconceptualizes the adaptive opaque facades concept, taking the opportunity of doing high-risk/low-TRL research in an interdisciplinary environment to bring cutting edge novelties from aerospace, biomedicine, nanomaterials, chemistry and IOT to building sector. The objective is to scientifically prove that ZERAF concept can control all heat transfer mechanisms in opaque building façades to a significant level. Prototypes will be manufactured for the first time and their thermal behaviour will be characterized in a dedicated laboratory coupling a calorimeter and a continuous sun simulator. To prove that used materials, fabrication processes and assembly methods do not jeopardize the carbon footprint reduction, most relevant sustainability parameters will be quantified through a building life cycle method.	energy saving; opaque facades as thermal modulators; smart materials; adaptive insulation; bio-based polyurethanes; control algorithms; carbon neutrality; buildings;	ACCADEMIA EUROPEA DI BOLZANO	TECHNISCHE UNIVERSITEIT EINDHOVEN, INGPULS SMART SHADINGS GMBH, INDRESMAT SL, ACTIVE INSULATION SYSTEMS B.V.	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101098490/program/43108390/details	
Biocatalytic membranes for micro/nano plastic degradation within waste water effluents (BMRex)	The universal use of different types of plastic-based materials as new products to meet the insatiable global demands of the 20th century has had an unprecedented impact on our evolution as a society. Unfortunately, micro- and nano-plastics are now ubiquitous in marine and freshwater environments, as well as terrestrial ecosystems, where they act as a source of highly detrimental toxic chemicals that negatively affect the environment and human health by interacting with terrestrial organisms that mediate ecosystem services and functions, such as soil dwelling invertebrates, terrestrial fungi and plant pollinators. It is our duty as scientists to provide immediate and appropriate solutions to control the fate and reduce the effects of micro/nano-plastics on our planet. BMRex will develop entirely new concepts for micro/nano-plastic removal from household and industrial waste water effluents by validating a novel biocatalyst-based membrane reactor technology to degrade plastic waste avoiding further damage. The consortium will produce, test & optimize biocatalytic membrane reactors based on porous inorganic scaffolds functionalized with ionic liquid materials modified for biofouling resistance, plastic affinity and controlled attachment of plastic-degrading enzymes. Interchangeable enzyme species will permit a precise control of stepwise catalytic processes enhanced with artificial cytosis, maximizing activity and stability of the biocatalytic reactions. BMRex will also evaluate the economic and technological viability of this novel technology. With its unique integration of scientific approaches, competences and resources, BMRex has the potential to open up an entirely new technological field. In the long term, this project aims to enable an in situ, more efficient and safer recycling of waste waters with transformative effects on a society that is currently in the very early phases of transitioning toward an environmentally sustainable use of plastic.

Pollinator-assisted plant natural selection and breeding under climate change pressure (DARkWIN)	Food security is threatened by climate change, with heat and drought being the main stresses affecting crop physiology and ecosystem services, such as plant-pollinator interactions. Despite the increasing relevance of flowers in sensing the stress, phenotyping platforms aim at identifying genetic traits of resilience by assessing the physiological status of the plants, usually through remote sensing-assisted vegetative indexes, but find strong bottlenecks in quantifying flower traits and in accurate genotype-to-phenotype prediction. However, as the transport of photoassimilates from leaves (sources) to flowers (sinks) is reduced in low-resilient plants, flowers are better indicators than leaves of plant well-being. Indeed, the chemical composition of flowers changes in response to heat and drought, as it does the amount of pollen and nectar that flowers produce, which ultimately serve as food recourses for the pollinators. DARkWIN proposes to track and rank pollinators’ preferences for flowers of a tomato mapping population exposed to heat and drought as a measure of functional source-to-sink relationships. To achieve this goal, DARkWIN will develop a pollinator-assisted selection and phenotyping platform for automated quantification of Genotype x Pollinator x Environment interactions through a bumblebee geo-positioning system. Pollinator-assisted selection for agriculture will be validated by a multi-omics dataset of unprecedented dimensions in a mapping population of tomato, including floral metabolic, transcriptomic, and ionomic traits, as well as mapping candidate genes, linking floral traits, pollinator preferences, and plant resilience. Moreover, DARkWIN will deliver tomato F1 pre-commercial varieties based on the natural biological process of pollinatordriven selection under climate change conditions. This radical new approach can change the current paradigm of plant phenotyping and find new paths for crop breeding assisted by ecological decisions.	plant breeding; plant phenotyping; stress resilience; geo-positioning; plant x pollinator x environment; flower metabolism; natural selection; multi-omics; ecosystem services; source-sink-relations	AGENCIA ESTATAL CONSEJO SUPERIOR DE INVESTIGACIONES CIENTIFICAS	MAX-PLANCK-GESELLSCHAFT ZUR FORDERUNG DER WISSENSCHAFTEN EV, UNIGENIA SEMILLAS SL, DORIANE SAS, NOVEDADES AGRICOLAS SA	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101098680/program/43108390/details	
Sustainable Bioinspired Wax Coating for Multi-Functional Crop Protection (SafeWax)	According to the FAO, plant diseases cost the global economy around 210€ billion per year, and fungal pathogens destroy at least a third of all food crops annually. Commercial agriculture relies on chemical fungicides for crop protection owing to their easy application and low cost; however, their overuse and misuse have devastating implications for all living systems and the entire ecosystem. Thus, establishing sustainable crop protection strategies is essential for global economic development, environmental protection, and food security. Inspired by superhydrophobic plants, such as lotus and broccoli which exhibit wax crystals on their cuticles, we propose a generic sustainable strategy for passive crop protection against fungal pathogens. Our biomimetic technology, termed SafeWax, relies on bio-derived non-toxic fatty acid-based sprayable formulations which self-assemble into a multifaceted protective coating with anti-adhesive, self-cleaning and antifungal properties. When applied on sensitive crops, which do not naturally exhibit wax crystals, SafeWax will synthetically render their foliage to passively resist pathogens. SafeWax concepts will initially be demonstrated on grapevine, as a relevant model crop of high importance to Europe’s economy, environment and culture, which is highly susceptible to fungal diseases and is the most-frequently treated crop. SafeWax will then be expanded to other sensitive commodity crops. The biodegradable SafeWax coating will not only protect crops from fungal infections but will also be tuned to provide UV radiation filtering, prevent sun damage, as well as facilitate water collection from dew condensation, mitigating inevitable effects of climate change.

Quantum Generative Adversarial Networks with phoTonic Integrated Circuits (QuGANTIC) (QuGANTIC)	The rapidly growing global adaptation of digital technologies has brought an exponential increase in data and computing power consumption, and conventional supercomputers are now reaching their limit in terms of power and energy efficiency. Quantum computers have garnered attention as a way to overcome the struggles of classical computers. Technological progress is happening fast, but the so-called quantum advantage results reported have no meaningful real-world tasks yet, and severe scaling problems remain. An alternative strategy of encoding information in high-dimensional spaces (using quDits rather than qubits) is extremely promising for enhancing computational capacity, accuracy, speed, and noise robustness. However, this approach is still in its infancy. QuGANTIC proposes a science-towards-technology breakthrough in scalable data loading and learning with quantum processors, based on a novel concept of hybrid integration on a single photonic integrated chip (PIC). Our innovative target is the first quantum computer using quDits generated by quantum frequency combs with the potential to execute operations in a reduced number of steps and provide the first scalable PIC quantum computer. Learning distributions of data and generating artificial samples is a formidable task for classical computers, and we will use our novel quDit PIC platform to demonstrate that so-called quantum Generative Adversarial Networks can solve this task far better than classical systems. Our goal will make an unprecedented impact on economy, science and society, as it will predict the behavior of globally critical areas such as energy distribution, weather phenomena, risk assessments and epidemic spreads, by processing vast data sets with a drastic reduction of computational overheads. Our processors have a credible path to market, and QuGANTIC has the right hardware and software Partners to realize this enormous potential.	quantum computing, quantum optics, photonics, electronics, quantum software	AARHUS UNIVERSITET	GOTTFRIED WILHELM LEIBNIZ UNIVERSITAET HANNOVER, TECHNISCHE UNIVERSITEIT EINDHOVEN, QUIX QUANTUM BV, KVANTIFY APS	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101099430/program/43108390/details	
twiN-on-a-chip brAins for monitoring individual sleeP habits (NAP)	Insufficient sleep is an under-reported epidemic and sleep disturbances are common early signs of neurodegeneration. Clinical research is currently challenging the assumption that human sleep is a one-fits-all phenomenon: breaking new grounds into sleep research is needed. NAP makes real the study of individual sleep pathophysiology through a new science-to-technology paradigm merging in vitro modelling, allometric scaling, signal processing and micromanufacturing. NAP targets five breakthroughs: 1) the development of the first model enabling the accurate study of individual sleep, 2) the realization of the cyborganoid, i.e., the next generation of biohybrid model of the human brain, 3) the setup of an experimental procedure to mimic sleep in vitro accounting for a person’s lifestyle, metabolism and genetic makeup, 4) the exploitation of allometry to obtain meaningful information from in vitro to humans and 5) the delivery of the first tool for Parkinson’s Disease (PD) early diagnosis. As a Proof of Principle, NAP will identify the effects of sleep deprivation and detect sleep-related signs of PD in a personalised perspective. In the long-term, NAP will move Europe to lead sleep research and innovation through its envisioned technology: a predictive medicine twin-on-a-chip allowing the public at large to be routinely screened for i) checking their sleep health, ii) being warned about the consequences of sleep loss, iii) predating PD and other neuropathies characterized by sleep anomalies. This will be of benefit for science, society and economy. NAP Proof of Principle will deliver the first tool for accurately extrapolating biological parameters from in vitro to humans. The identification of individual sleep needs will allow the targeted detection of people suffering from sleep disorders, scaling back healthcare costs. Sleep-related neurodegeneration biomarkers will have tremendous implications in pharmacological research and enterprise and in the healthcare sector	sleep in vitro, allometric scaling, human brain models, 3D electrophysiology, calcium imaging, signal processing	UNIVERSITA DI PISA	ALBERT-LUDWIGS-UNIVERSITAET FREIBURG, ORGANOTHERAPEUTICS VGMBH, UNIVERSITEIT VAN AMSTERDAM, ATLAS NEUROENGINEERING BVBA, SLEEPACTA S.R.L.	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101099310/program/43108390/details	
Bioorthogonal Implantable Iontronic Switch to Temporally Control the Local Release of Chemotherapeutics (bioSWITCH)	Our vision for a new type of cancer treatment is based on an implantable therapeutic system capable of ‘programmable’ on-demand delivery of drugs directly to the tumor. We conceive an implantable iontronic switch (bioSWITCH) to enable a spatiotemporally controlled administration of highly potent chemotherapeutics, without the need for systemic administration of (pro)drugs or drug conjugates. This radically new technology will be realized by a combination of next-level tools. As a result, bioSWITCH can generate previously unobtainable discrete as well as continuous drug concentration profiles at the tumor site, and thus allows for the use of highly potent drugs that are otherwise not applicable due to high cytotoxicity. The goal is to demonstrate the technology’s potential to effectively interfere with tumor progression using a xenograft pancreas cancer mouse model. Efficiently shrinking tumors in size allows for surgical resection of previously non-operable tumors and dramatically increases survival rates. Our consortium of world leading academics and pioneering SMEs will ensure the translation of this disruptive technology into the market to maximize the socioeconomic impact.	bioelectronics, drug delivery, pancreatic cancer, bioorthogonal tools, implanted devices, iontronics	LINKOPINGS UNIVERSITET	TAGWORKS PHARMACEUTICALS BV, TECHNISCHE UNIVERSITAET WIEN, SUPRAPOLIX BV, MEDIZINISCHE UNIVERSITAT GRAZ, OBOE IPR AB	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101099963/program/43108390/details	
ULTRA-LIGHT, SELF-CORRECTING, “LIVE” MIRRORS: Lowering the areal density of mirrors and maximizing performance with non-abrasive, additive, 3D-printed novel technology. (Live-Mirror)	We propose to develop ultralight, self-correcting mirrors for use in the next generation of large optical telescopes and solar energy concentrators. Presently, the best mirrors have a density of about one-half a metric-ton per square-meter or more in order to provide the stiffness which is necessary to keep the optical shape under the variable conditions given by the changing gravity vector as the telescopes track a position on the sky, as well as to withstand variable wind conditions. We intend to replace such a massive mirror with a “sandwich” of very light, optically perfect, “fire-glass” (window pane) coated sheets stiffened with layers of Electro-active polymers that can be deposited through additive manufacturing 3D printers. The sheets of glass will be heated to ~800o C in a pressurized, tailored made kiln and allowed to relax (their backside) onto a suitable mould, cast to a predetermined off-axis aspheric (parabolic) shape, while keeping the temperature below the de-vitrification temperature of the glass thus preserving the excellent optical surface quality of fire-glass window pane. Using the addressable energy of the Electro-active polymers will provide not only dynamically self-controlled stiffness but also variable push-pull action real-time multi-sensing controlled and calibrated in order to keep the optical surface to a “live-perfect” shape under general operating conditions. These “Live-Mirrors” shall provide optical surfaces of as high a quality as those of the current best telescopes but with larger dynamic range and a reduction in weight and cost of more than one order of magnitude. Such mirrors will allow the development of 50-100 meter-class telescopes as well as of the next generation of space telescopes. On the ground, they will also offer very low cost options for the next generation of solar energy concentrators and for antennas used for optical communications.	additive manufacturing, Electro-active polymers force-actuator, hybrid meta-material, large lightweight optical mirror, multi-sensing control, glass slumping, aspheric shape determination	CENTRE NATIONAL DE LA RECHERCHE SCIENTIFIQUE CNRS	INSTITUT NATIONAL DES SCIENCES APPLIQUEES DE LYON, FUNDACION AITIIP, NEOTECH AMT GMBH, LEIBNIZ-INSTITUT FUER NEUE MATERIALIEN GEMEINNUETZIGE GMBH	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101099220/program/43108390/details	
Single Molecule Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Microscopy for Complex Spin Systems (4D-NMR)	Nanotechnology is emerging as a key area to address global challenges in health, energy, environment and information technologies. However, we are still investigating most nanomaterials with bulk techniques, averaging over large samples, instead of looking at one single nanostructure with true nanoscale sensors. Particularly, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) as our workhorse for bio/chemical synthesis and medical imaging is inherently limited to bulk samples. The most fundamental challenge, to turn NMR from an ensemble-measurement technique (Commercial NMRs typically have a sensitivity of billions of molecules) into a nanocale technique remains unsolved. In this project we will overcome this challenge by reaching single molecule sensitivity, thus converting NMR into an imaging technique thanks to the exploitation of the unparalleled atomic resolution of the scanning probe microscopy (SPM) technology. This breakthrough will be based on resonant, high frequency, electro-magnetic excitation and readout including important advances in GHz technology. We will use the capabilities of the novel technology to demonstrate detection of single spin NMR and to test the limits of our understanding of nuclear-electron interactions, probing the physics of molecular nanoobjects, 1D carbon nanoribbons with delocalized coherent states, and 2D atomically-thin magnetic materials. This novel technology will not only open up new fundamental scientific insights but should also have a strong impact in the markets of NMR and SPM. In this context, the project will be a keystone, demonstrating the novel platform conceived as a versatile upgrade for commercially-available SPMs, that can routinely operate in various environments (vacuum, ambient, liquid) with a variety of molecules and materials.

A distributed data-mining software platform for extreme data across the compute continuum (EXTRACT)	Data has become one of the most valuable assets, driving the digital transformation across many sectors. Current data mining solutions are optimized to deal with specific data requirements, but fail to cope as the data characteristics become extreme. There is therefore an urgent need for novel and holistic approaches to enable the development, deployment and efficient execution of data mining workflows across a heterogeneous, secure and energy-efficient compute continuum, while fulfilling the diverse extreme data characteristics. To fill this technological gap, EXTRACT will deliver a data-driven open-source software platform integrating the most relevant technologies, to facilitate the development of trustworthy, accurate, fair and green data mining workflows able to generate high-quality actionable knowledge. The EXTRACT platform will improve the complete lifecycle of extreme data mining workflows, significantly enhancing performance, energy-efficiency, scalability and security, while fulfilling the extreme data characteristics in a holistic way. Moreover, multiple computing technologies, from edge to cloud to HPC, will be integrated into a unified and secure compute continuum. Specifically, the platform will feature enhanced data infrastructures and AI & big-data frameworks, novel data-driven orchestration and distributed monitoring mechanisms, a unified continuum abstraction and cybersecurity and digital privacy across all software layers. The EXTRACT platform will be validated in two real-world use-cases with different extreme data requirements: 1) a Personalized Evacuation Route service, integrating data from the European data sources, Copernicus and Galileo, with 5G localization signals and smart city IoT sensors for civilian-centric crisis management; and 2) Transient Astrophysics with a SKA pathfinder, processing extreme data from 2000 radio-telescopes for the real-time assessment of solar activity, generating knowledge for further scientific exploitation.	extreme data; interoperable compute continuum; data infrastructure; ; AI & big-data workflows; data-driven orchestration; edge-to-cloud-to-HPC; European data sources; cybersecurity; energy-efficiency	BARCELONA SUPERCOMPUTING CENTER CENTRO NACIONAL DE SUPERCOMPUTACION	IKERLAN S.

NGI Zero Core (NGI0 Core)	We fund a large amount of third parties to review and upgrade the open Internet architecture (hardware, software, protocols) to increase the performance of the network, adapt it to new application requirements, improve quality of service, make it more resilient to security threats, more energy efficient and respectful of the environment (e.g. reparability, recyclability), and increasingly supportive of open and decentralised technologies and services. With the size of the budget available and our methodology, NGI0 Core involves 150 000 to 300 000 person hours of directly funded human effort contributed to the public benefit and the good of the internet. A multiple of that will be generated indirectly within the ecosystem around open source and standards. NGI0 Foundations is important to set the course of the evolution of technology and strengthening the role of Europe within future developments.

Materials for Sustainable Sodium-Ion Capacitors (MUSIC)	Materials for sUstainable Sodium Ion Capacitors responds to the need of a new supercapacitor technology that reaches energy density comparable to that of power batteries, but still recharges within few seconds and offers long cycle life with minimum efficiency loss over time. Moreover, MUSIC incorporates a strong policy of sustainability and environmental friendliness. Thus, any use of CRM will be avoided for the development of the SIC technology and will develop advanced novel carbonaceous electrode materials, binders and green electrolytes that are sustainable by design. Finally, the consortium will develop new manufacturing processes and industrial value chains by developing a new, transversal-to-other EES technologies, presodiation approach, which is low-cost and solution processable, enabling the industrialization of the technology. , MUSIC will fabricate SIC prototype cells and will develop a 12V module prototype that incorporates an innovative management system to monitor the SoC, SoH, SoP of individual cells.

OPEN FAN VALIDATION FOR CARBON-FREE AIRCRAFTS (PANDORA)	The open fan concept has been around for decades. Its high propulsive efficiency combined with the elimination of the nacelle drag and weight has been always appealing to replace high by-pass ratio ducted fans and reduce CO2 and NOx emissions. The CS1 and CS2 programs have made relevant efforts to pursue the contra-rotating open rotor (CROR) concept as well. Though CROR has not made it to market, progress has been done reducing noise levels to that of ducted fans. Open fans exhibit several differences with respect to ducted fans which by today are highly sophisticated components accumulating decades of research. The chasm between the OP concept and its product is too big to be covered by a single demonstrator since a wrong materialization of the idea can give rise to misleading conclusions. Turbomachinery simulations have been perfected for decades and are essential to close the gap between the concept and the detailed implementation of the product. However, open rotors exacerbate existing problems (e.g., blade-to-blade variations even for small angles of attack, strong coupling between CO2 and noise emissions, etc.). Moreover, open fans lack publicly available data or test cases preventing researchers from validating their ideas. The first global assessment of CS2 reported an expected noise reduction of -9dB in the innovative TP 130 pax project with respect to the last generation of ducted fans though at a lower flight Mach number. This project aims to obtain relevant noise and performance experimental data of an unducted single fan (USF) for the short/medium-range aircraft with two objectives. Firstly, confirm that about 5-10 dB noise reduction is achievable at the expense of a slight penalty in fan efficiency, and secondly, validate and expand the scope of numerical tools. An experimental database with the key results of the projects will be built to unlock the application of the USF for SAF, Hydrogen, and Hybrid-electric engine and aircraft configurations.

Collaborative Radio - Light Detection And Ranging (CoRaLi-DAR)	This proposal aims at developing an advanced detection and ranging sensor system based on a collaborative scheme, integrating on the same module both radio and light-based sensing. The module will consist of: a silicon photonics solid-state light detection and ranging (LiDAR) chip, with integrated laser source and driver electronics; a CMOS radio detection and ranging (RADAR) chip connected to a single transmitting (Tx) and receiving (Rx) set of antennas; a processing unit (PU) to actively control the two sensors and process the generated data. The LiDAR and RADAR chip will be integrated on the same printed circuit board (PCB) avoiding any use of free space optics. The proposed architecture will allow an active cooperation of the two sensors through an advanced algorithm installed on the PU. CoRaLi-DAR advanced sensor system will exploit LiDAR’s high-resolution capabilities, and RADAR’s strong reliability in adverse weather conditions, to deliver an automotive compatible detection and ranging system. The use of fully integrated photonics and electronics will reduce packaging size, manufacturing cost and ultimately operational power. With CoRaLi-DAR we plan to create a low-cost, low power and reliable sensor system that can be used as a platform for the automotive market and beyond.

Open-Source Cloud-Based Services on EPI Systems (OpenCUBE)	This project proposes to design OpenCUBE, a full-stack solution of a validated European Cloud computing blueprint to be deployed on European hardware infrastructure. OpenCUBE will develop a custom cloud installation with the guarantee that an entirely European solution like SiPearl processors and Semidynamics RISC-V accelerators can be deployed reproducibly. OpenCUBE will be built on industry-standard open APIs using Open Source components and will provide a unified software stack that captures the different best practices and open source tooling on the operating system, middleware, and system management level. It will thus provide a solid basis for the European cloud services, research, and commercial deployments envisioned to be core for federated digital services via Gaia-X. To remain competitive for the European Green Deal, OpenCUBE is designed to make energy awareness a core feature at all levels of the stack, exploiting the advanced features of the SiPearl Rhea processor family at the hardware level and exposing the necessary API at the site level, up to and including interfaces to the electricity grid. This project will leverage representative workloads like those of ECMWF characteristics for production and Digital Twin workflows as drivers for the design and deployment of the cluster infrastructure. We will collaborate closely with the projects developing the virtual environments and the open hardware interfaces for current and future European processor and coprocessor technology.

Quantum Internet Alliance - Phase1 (QIA-Phase1)	The mission of the Quantum Internet Alliance (QIA) is to build a global Quantum Internet made in Europe – by developing a full-stack prototype network, and by driving an innovative European Quantum Internet ecosystem capable of scaling the network to worldleading European technology. Building on its proven track record in teamwork, which has already resulted in world first Quantum Internet technology, QIA advances this mission in two complementary objectives: The first is the realization of a full-stack prototype network able to distribute entanglement between two metropolitan-scale networks via a long-distance backbone (>500 km) using quantum repeaters. The second is the establishment of a European platform for Quantum Internet development, which will act as a catalyst for a European Quantum Internet Ecosystem including actors all along the value chain. QIA’s network will enable advanced quantum-network applications and prepare the ground for secure quantum computing in the cloud, thanks to our new generation of end nodes including both processing nodes and low-cost photonic client devices. Nodes in the metropolitan network will be interconnected via hubs that allow the scalable connection of hundreds of end nodes, paving the way for early adopters. The long-distance backbone will be realized using fully functional quantum repeaters unlocking Pan-European end-to-end quantum communication. QIA’s prototype network will operate on standard optical fibers and serves to validate all key sub-systems, ready to be scaled by European industry. In this first SGA we will advance towards the long-term objectives set up in the FPA project.

Materials for a next-generation (nano-)opto-electro-mechanical systems (MAGNIFIC)	Nano-opto-electro-mechanics (NOEMS) is an emerging field with unparalleled prospects for the design of efficient and low-power devices for ICT. However, to capitalize NOEMS potential, a flexible and up-scalable technology platform must be established, preferably based on current microelectronic technology. MAGNIFIC aims at filling this gap focusing on nanocrystalline silicon (nc-Si), only recently used in NOEMS with very promising results, and its integration with columnar aluminium nitride. Indeed, while nc-Si is widely used in MEMS production, the dynamics of such an optically and electrically active nanocrystalline material has barely been investigated, leaving fundamental gaps in the understanding of the interplay between electrons, phoTons and phoNons. In this context, we propose an up-scalable, cost efficient, room temperature and Si-compatible nano-opto-electro-mechanical platform for powering efficient communications technologies. The key challenge is to achieve a comprehensive understanding of the static and dynamic material properties and their interdependence. In particular, understanding the role of nano-crystallites and grain boundaries in absorption and in dissipation mechanisms at the nanoscale is crucial for energy efficiency and for reliable performance as they are intrinsically linked to losses and variability. The aimed platform will provide a coherent interface between RF electronics and telecom-wavelength optics mediated by phoNons, able to provide different functionalities (local oscillation, frequency conversion, modulation) in highly compact, energy efficient devices. The project starts at TRL3, achieved via two previous EC projects, and brings the system to TRL5 realizing devices and circuits, suitably packaged, and environmentally tested with RF frequencies in the 3-12 GHz range. This will allow to cover a broad variety of ICT applications including pervasive wireless networks (5G and beyond), smart cities, IoT and satellite communications.

Single Photon source and detector based on novel materials for the detection of endocrine disruptors (GREENER)	Water is one of the most important natural resources on earth and despite increasingly strict regulations, contamination of water that poses a health risk is still a major problem. In Europe, too, our drinking water is exposed to contaminants such as hormones, which even in extremely low concentrations can have effects on humans and animals and are therefore of interest for water monitoring in the context of nature conservation and also various branches of industry. Our goal in this project is to provide the layperson with a ready-to-use, compact, and robust spectrometer capable of measuring extremely low concentrations in the sub ng/L range. To this end, the GREENER project aims to develop new, environmentally friendly QDs capable of near-infrared absorption measurements at emission wavelengths as short as 2µm. These will be singulated by the DNA origami method and integrated into an LED layer stack to synthesize a novel kind of single-photon source. Combined with advanced single-photon detectors enabled by new detector materials that do not require expensive cryogenic coolers but rely on simple thermoelectric cooling, a setup for low-loss, low-noise and high-performance spectroscopy for the Vis to NIR range will be developed. The resulting biosensor will subsequently be evaluated for the detection of critical (endocrine disrupting) contaminants in water in fisheries and aquaponics and will enable end-users to monitor water safety and quality on-side without additional infrastructure or trained personnel.

Fast gated superconducting nanowire camera for multi-functional optical tomograph (fastMOT)	Traditionally, monitoring of organs and deep body functional imaging is done by ultrasound, X-Rays (incl CT), PET or MRI. These techniques only allow for very limited measurements of functionality, usually combined with exogenous and radioactive agents. In this project we propose an innovative light sensing solution, a fast gated, ultra-high quantum efficiency single-photon sensor, to enable multi-functional deep body imaging with diffuse optics. The new type of sensor is based on superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors, that have shown to be ultra-fast and highly efficient. However, until now the active area and number of pixels has been limited to micrometers diameter and tens of pixels. We propose the combination of two new readout techniques, optical gating and charge coupling, to overcome this limit and scale to 10,000 pixels and millimeter diameter. In addition we will develop new strategies for performing TD-NIRS and TD-SCOS to use this new light sensor optimally with Monte-Carlo simulations. We will implement the new light sensor in an optical tomograph and achieve a 100x improvement of SNR compared to using existing light sensors.

Making The Invisible Visible for Off-Highway Machinery by Conveying Extended Reality Technologies (THEIA-XR)	THEIA-XR (Making the invisible visible for off-highway machinery by conveying extended reality technologies) aims at improving human-machine interaction in mobile machinery by enhancing user technology fit and extending reality technologies and functionalities. The results will make the invisible visible respectively the non-perceivable perceivable to the human operator, extending the perceivable range of the operator without negatively influencing the performance of the human while controlling the machinery. The project will ensure positive impact of eXtended Reality technologies on the safety, security trustworthiness and societal aspects of the interaction between the machine, the human operator and public/non-users, and furthermore create an XR workplace that enables positive user experiences of self-efficacy and meaningfulness of work. THEIA-XR will leverage a human-centred transdisciplinary and scenario-based co-design methodology with users, stakeholders and multidisciplinary researchers as a fully integrated project team. This methodology serves to collect human requirements and to design, develop and deploy the extended reality technologies for information presentation and interaction in the off-highway domain. The targeted extended reality technologies will enhance conventional human-machine interfaces through multi-modal information and interaction technologies, deploying innovative data visualization methods, force feedback technology and acoustic information. The THEIA-XR approach for improving the human operator tasks by deploying extended reality technologies will be initially validated and tested in three uses cases in the off-highway domain, targeting snow grooming, logistics and construction scenarios, integrating real end-users, public/non-users and real-life data from dedicated industrial environments.	eXtended Reality, Off-Highway Machinery, Transdisciplinary Co-Design, Human-Machine Interaction, User Experience	TTCONTROL GMBH	TECHNISCHE UNIVERSITAET GRAZ, TECHNISCHE UNIVERSITAET DRESDEN, HOCHSCHULE DER MEDIEN, UNIVERSITE DU LUXEMBOURG, TEKNOLOGIAN TUTKIMUSKESKUS VTT OY, CREANEX OY, HAPTION SA, PRINOTH SPA, CARGOTEC FINLAND OY	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101092861/program/43108390/details	
Impact and viability of a novel mass PCR testing method as a pandemic-fighting strategy (PCR-4-ALL)	The COVID-19 pandemic has not only affected our health, but also our lifestyles and our economies. Given its high non-symptomatic transmissibility, to stop a pandemic-causing pathogen like SARS-CoV-2 early on its tracks without needing to resort to economy-damaging measures, would have required a mass testing strategy very early on: according to some estimates up to 10% of a nation’s population should have been tested on a daily basis to achieve this. Given the exponential growth tendency of pandemic-causing respiratory viruses, as soon as such pathogen is identified a large-scale testing campaign should immediate be deployed (a strategy adopted successfully in very densely populated areas of China). And given the long periods required to develop other pandemic-fighting strategies (i.e. such as vaccines and quick diagnostic tests), PCR-based mass testing could be the ideal front line of defense, since it can be developed in only a few weeks after decoding the genetic map of the pathogen. But although PCR testing capacity has greatly been increased worldwide, regularly testing large fractions of the population would still remain prohibitively costly with current technology. The PCR-4-ALL consortium (combining expertise in diagnostics, high-throughput-screening, virology, disease modelling, econometrics and digital health platforms) will aim to demonstrate the technical feasibility of carrying out population-wide PCR testing by demonstrating a capacity of >10^5 tests in a single day and platform, in an extremely cost-effective manner (at least 2 orders of magnitude cheaper than currently). We will, furthermore, evaluate the effectiveness of utilizing this strategy as the main pandemic-fighting measure by assessing its ability to minimize, or even prevent, the need to implement other costly and partially ineffective measures (i.e. lockdowns and vaccination campaigns).

Improving treatment efficacy in hypertension by biomarker-guided personalised decision support (HT-ADVANCE)	In HT-ADVANCE we aim to revolutionise personalised management of arterial hypertension (HT) by using multi-omics (MOMICS) stratification biomarkers as companion diagnostics for the prescription of existing drugs. HT is the most important global risk factor for death and morbidity but is uncontrolled in more than 50% of patients. Causes of treatment failure include lack of identification of secondary forms such as endocrine hypertension (EHT) which can be curable by specific therapy. In addition, there is variable response to individual drugs and trial-and-error treatment leads to poor HT control and frustration for both patients and clinicians. The objective of HT-ADVANCE is to validate two multicomponent stratification biomarkers in patients with HT in order to i) identify patients with EHT, and ii) predict response to treatment in patients with primary hypertension. The hypothesis is that MOMICS biomarkers reflect specific forms of hypertension and susceptibility to specific drugs. To this end, we will run three clinical trials (HT-ENDO, HT-TREAT and HT-PREDICT) and apply machine learning techniques to integrate the genetic, genomic and metabolomic features that constitute the MOMICS biomarkers in order to generate accurate diagnostic and therapeutic response predictions for clinicians. We will also perform economic evaluation of the use of MOMICS for the treatment of HT, produce ethical and legal recommendations for clinical decision making, and develop a plan for their implementation as companion diagnostics. The study will be conducted by several HT Centres of Excellence and will build on the success of the ENSAT-HT project that has established methods and pipelines for integrating datasets derived from multiple platforms. We expect that HT-ADVANCE will provide a step change in the management of HT by enabling a personalised, more efficient and cost-effective treatment strategy, and importantly, will prevent the ensuing cardio-metabolic complications.	hypertension, endocrine hypertension, multicomponent biomarker, companion diagnostic, prediction, therapeutic response, personalised medicine , omics	INSTITUT NATIONAL DE LA SANTE ET DE LA RECHERCHE MEDICALE	STICHTING RADBOUD UNIVERSITAIR MEDISCH CENTRUM, INSERM TRANSFERT SA, UNIVERSITA DEGLI STUDI DI TORINO, TECHNISCHE UNIVERSITAET DRESDEN, CLINIQUE UNIVERSITAIRE SAINT-LUC ASBL, HELMHOLTZ ZENTRUM MUENCHEN DEUTSCHES FORSCHUNGSZENTRUM FUER GESUNDHEIT UND UMWELT GMBH, UNIVERSITE PAUL SABATIER TOULOUSE III, ASSISTANCE PUBLIQUE HOPITAUX DE PARIS, UNIVERSITA DEGLI STUDI DI PADOVA	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101095407/program/43108390/details	
Personalized Drug Response: IMplementation and Evaluation in CKD (PRIME-CKD)	Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is one of the major causes of death in high income countries and its prevalence is growing rapidly. New therapies for the treatment of CKD have shown clear efficacy at a population level. Yet, individual patients respond differently with many patients showing suboptimal efficacy. This indicates that a ‘one size fits all’ approach is no longer sustainable. Currently there are no validated pharmacodynamic biomarkers in CKD that aid in guiding optimal therapy for individual patients. Furthermore, there remains a large gap between biomarker research and actual implementation of biomarker based care in daily clinical practice. Thus, there is an urgent need to validate and translate biomarkers as tools for daily clinical practice. PRIME-CKD has a unique advantage to address this challenge as it builds on recently discovered pharmacodynamic biomarkers for CKD treatment, and has access to a vast amount of clinical data, bio-samples. PRIME CKD will: 1) Provide a breakthrough in the pharmacotherapy of CKD with the validation and implementation of pharmacodynamic biomarkers which will advance personalized medicine. 2) Scientifically validate innovative clinical trial elements, pipelines and qualification procedures that can be used by researchers, diagnostics industries and regulatory authorities. 3) Establish a Stakeholder Network to truly engage patients, clinicians and other stakeholders in implementation of personalized medicines 4) Develop a roadmap for biomarker use in daily clinical practice for the optimal treatment of CKD. These results will enable clinicians to match patients with CKD with the most effective available drug within the shortest possible timeframe leading to less disease burden and progression of disease, enhanced quality of life and increased cost-efficiency. PRIME-CKD results will thus unlock the potential of biomarkers in healthcare and close the gap between biomarker research and clinical use in daily practice.

Combining DISsimilar materials into functional large-scale and light-weight COmponents and structures (DISCO2030)	The DISCO2030 project aims to develop two innovative hybrid manufacturing methods for joining dissimilar metal-metal and metal-polymer materials. Both proposed methods are underpinned by additive manufacturing (AM) technologies from the emerging technology families of Powder Bed Fusion (PBF) and Directed Energy Deposition (DED). DISCO2030 combines the advantages of PBF and DED to enable the manufacturing of multi-material lightweight, complex geometry components/structures that are able to operate in harsh environments. The process is expected to achieve a ≥20% lead time reduction compared to state-of-the-art manufacturing processes (such as die casting and brazing) and manufacture multi-material parts that have a 50% lower weight compared to reference products and a 30% higher performance (achieved among others by graded materials). The three use-cases to be demonstrated in the project are of high relevance to the EU economy and include a rocket engine, a marine engine and a cryogenic hydrogen tank for primary applications in the automotive sector. All components manufactured using the novel DISCO hybrid manufacturing methods will be subjected to rigid testing according to the respective industry standards. DISCO2030 is expected to generate significant impact by paving the way for the creation of new dissimilar material joining and testing standards, strengthening the EU’s leadership in AM technologies and increasing the EU’s resilience against global supply chain disruptions. Finally, DISCO2030 will contribute to the reinvention of the European aerospace, marine and automotive sectors, ultimately providing EU citizens with better, more sustainable and cost-effective transportation.

Medium-range hybrid low-pollution flexi-fuel/hydrogen sustainable engine (MYTHOS)	MYTHOS proposes to develop a demonstrated innovative and disruptive design methodology for future short/medium range civil engines capable of using a wide range of liquid and gaseous fuels including SAFs and, ultimately, pure hydrogen, thus aiming at fulfilling the objective of decarbonize civil aviation as fore-seen by the ACARE SRIA short, mid and long-term Goals by 2050. To achieve these, the MYTHOS consor-tium develops and adopts a multidisciplinary multi-fidelity modelling approach for the characterization of the relevant engine components deploying the full power of the method of machine learning. The latter will lead through hidden-physics discovery to advance data-driven reduced models which will be embedded in a holistic tool for the prediction of the environmental footprint of the civil aviation of all speeds. A unique aspect of the project is the high-fidelity experimental validation of the numerical approaches. MYTHOS consortium through this approach will contribute to reduce time-to-market for engines designed and engi-neered to burn various types of environmentally friendly fuels, such as SAF, in the short and medium term, and hydrogen, in the long term.

BioFunctional IntraNeural Electrodes (BioFINE)	BioFunctional IntraNeural Electrodes : In BioFINE we will develop flexible intraneural multielectrode arrays, capable of interfacing peripheral nerves e.g. to transfer input/output signals from bionic limbs. Specifically, we address the challenge of long term tissue integration and chronic stability, by addressing three aspects of biocompatibility: 1) We develop novel fabrication methods allowing the intraneural interface to be defined at even finer resolution than before; 2) we explore functionalizations which will control the tissue response by combined surface anchored and surface eluted agents; 3) we address structural biocompatibility on a system level by engineering novel implantable interconnects which reduced tethering forces and improve prospects for high channel count interfaces. Fine-tuned bioactivity will safe-guard surrounding neural tissue in the initial stages of healing, and implants of sub-cellular dimensions and tissue compatible biomechanics, will safe-guard tissue healthy in the longer term. The combined approach will offer optimal conditions to bridge the gap from electrode to neuron and generate a long term functional peripheral nerve interface. Indeed, each of the three technological advancements would on their own have substantial impact on neurotechnology, reaching far beyond intraneural interfaces.

Early Interception of Inflammatory-mediated Type 2 Diabetes (INTERCEPT-T2D)	The overall concept of INTERCEPT-T2D is to establish whether an inflammatory-mediated profile contributes to the onset of Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) complications, thus enabling the identification of patients most at risk of complications and the design of personalized prevention measures. T2D is a heterogeneous disease, which is an obstacle to the delivery of an optimal tailored treatment. Consequently, patients’ individual trajectories of progressive hyperglycemia and risk of chronic complications are so far difficult to predict. In this context, onset of diabetic complications represents the most important transitional phase of T2D development toward premature disability and mortality. Chronic systemic inflammation has been suggested to be a major contributor to the onset and progression of T2D complications. INTERCEPT-T2D will bring a new and clinically relevant dimension in T2D care considering at diagnosis inflammatory parameters that are of importance for the transition to T2D-related complications. The combination of state-of-the-art genomics and cell-biology technologies with targeted clinical interventions should lead to potent patients’ stratification. It should allow the identification and prognosis of a novel class or subclass of patients characterized by an “Inflammatory-mediated T2D” endotype. The project has access to the best-documented longitudinal human European cohorts of patients with T2D, with reliable clinical and biological data allowing to trace the transition and evolution towards organ complications. This, added to the exploitation of an extensive health data warehouse, will enable us to establish the inflammatory trajectory of citizens with T2D from diagnosis to the development of complications. To explore the ability to prevent the transition phase of T2D towards organ complications, INTERCEPT-T2D will conduct a phase II clinical trial with an anti-inflammatory therapy targeting NLRP3 Inflammasome activity in patients with T2D.

PANcreatic CAncer Initial Detection via liquid biopsy (PANCAID)	Pancreatic cancer (PDAC) is usually detected at late stages and most patients die within one year after diagnosis. In PANCAID we will therefore develop a blood test for early detection of PDAC. Despite tremendous technological advances in Liquid Biopsy Diagnostics (LBx), this goal is very ambitious because small tumors release only minute amounts of cells or cellular products (e.g., DNA, RNA, protein, metabolites) into the circulation. Thus, tests with a high sensitivity are required but increases in sensitivity are usually achieved on the expenses of reduced specificity which can lead to significant overdiagnosis leading to unnecessary stress for the individuals with a false-positive blood test and high costs for the health system. In PANCAID, we will therefore establish a blood test with high accuracy by analyzing large cohorts of patients with PDAC and its precursor lesions, individuals at risk to develop PDAC and appropriate age-matched control groups (healthy and non-cancer diseases frequent in the targeted population). Ambitious objectives of PANCAID include (1) establishment of a unique resource of blood samples of early PDAC and risk groups (WP1); (2) Establishment of a breakthrough blood test for early diagnosis of PDAC (WP2); (3) Identification of the best composite biomarker panel by integrating multimodal features in an AI-assisted computational analysis; (4) Analysis of the socio-economic impact of early PDAC diagnosis (WP4); and (5) Definition of the ethics parameters relevant to early PDAC detection (WP5). A robust multi-biomarker panel will be determined during the training period (year 1-3) and subsequently validated on bio-banked blood samples (year 4-5). Depending on the outcome of this comprehensive analysis, PANCAID will provide the design of a future prospective study for validation of the developed composite blood test in an international multi-center setting required to introduce LBx into screening programs for high-risk individuals. This action is part of the Cancer Mission cluster of projects on ‘Prevention, including Screening’.

Efficient QUantum ALgorithms for IndusTrY (EQUALITY)	A quantum revolution is unfolding, and European scientists are on the lead. Now, it is time to take decisive action and transform our scientific potential into a competitive advantage. Achieving this goal will be critical to ensuring Europe’s technological sovereignty in the coming decades. EQUALITY brings together scientists, innovators, and prominent industrial players with the mission of developing cutting-edge quantum algorithms to solve strategic industrial problems. The consortium will develop a set of algorithmic primitives which could be used as modules for various industry-specific workflows. These primitives include differential equation solvers, material simulation algorithms, quantum optimisers, etc. To focus our efforts, we target eight paradigmatic industrial problems. These problems are likely to yield to early quantum advantage and pertain to the aerospace and energy storage industries. They include airfoil aerodynamics, battery and fuel cell design, space mission optimisation, etc. Our goal is to develop quantum algorithms for real industrial problems using real quantum hardware. This requires grappling with the limitations of present-day quantum hardware. Thus, we will devote a large portion of our efforts to developing strategies for optimal hardware exploitation. These low-level implementations will account for the effects of noise and topology and will optimise algorithms to run on limited hardware. EQUALITY will build synergies with Quantum Flagship projects and Europe’s thriving ecosystem of quantum start-ups. Use cases will be tested on quantum hardware from three of Europe’s leading vendors and two HPC centres. The applications targeted have the potential of creating billions of euros for end-users and technology providers over the coming decades. With EQUALITY, we aim at playing a role in unlocking this value and placing Europe at the centre of this development. The project gathers 9 partners and has a budget of €6M over 3 years.

Multi-material additive manufacturing for lightweight and thermal management (MULTHEM)	The 26th Climate Change Conference has highlighted the urgent need to reduce global carbon dioxide emissions to limit global warming. The transport sector accounts for approx. 16% of the global carbon emissions and has identified fleet electrification as the primary route to achieving climate neutrality. However, the main challenges are the current weight of components and the cost of new systems to ensure efficiency and long-term sustainability. As a result, the industry has recognised the need for transformative technologies and production methods to develop lighter, more efficient, and cost-effective solutions to enable this transition and achieve climate neutrality. With their outstanding mechanical strength, Carbon Fibre Composites (CFC) have been increasingly used to replace metals in products requiring lightweight features, such as aircraft or high-performance vehicles. However, due to the traditional manufacturing process and poor thermal conductivity, the use of CFC has been limited to structural applications. For example, batteries, electrical motors, and power electronics, where power losses need to be efficiently dissipated, typically require separate heat exchangers, resulting in heavier and less cost-effective solutions that still utilize bulky designs and heavy materials. The vision of MULTHEM is to develop a reliable and validated Additively Manufactured (AM) CFC process with enhanced thermal conductivity with different material combinations and nanotechnology. This innovative approach will allow the development of components, such as battery and motor housings with dual functionality comprising structural and cooling features and with a more cost-effective approach than traditional methods. This solution will enhance the product performance, first by the weight reduction achieved by designs that only AM enables, and second, by using CFC-metal structures with enhanced thermal conductivity strategies, lighter and stronger than aluminium or steel.

Next generation data-driven reference European models and methods towards silent and green aircraft operations around airports (NEEDED)	NEEDED responds to the second and third bullets of the “expected outcome” of the HORIZON-CL5-2022-D5-01-12 topic, delivering the next generation data-driven reference European models and methods to estimate present and future aircraft emissions (pollutants and noise), achieving TRL 4 at the end of the project. To do so, NEEDED will advance the state of the art by: • improving the accuracy of the reconstruction of aircraft operations by using real-world ADS-B data, • advancing emission inventories for current and future aircraft technologies, while delivering more accurate pollution dispersion models, • extending the applicability of the ECAC Doc 29 noise model towards future aircraft technologies, • performing more accurate estimation of the number of people affected by local air transport operations by using dynamic population maps. These activities are complemented by (i) local air quality (LAQ) and experimental noise measurements performed at Rotterdam Airport, (ii) validation of the NEEDED toolchain in a 30-week pilot study involving three airports, and (iii) delivery of a methodology to optimise the flight patterns for minimum detrimental impact on the population in present and future scenarios. The project aims to function as a technology enabler, laying the methodological groundwork for facilitating the entry into service of transformative aircraft technologies while capitalising on the potential of ADS-B data. NEEDED ensures its impact on the next generation of Air Traffic Management (ATM) regulation and policies through the direct involvement of EUROCONTROL.

SKIN MICROBIAL DEVICES (SKINDEV)	The long-term vision and ambition of the SKINDEV consortium is to complement the human skin microbiome with Smart Skin Microbial Devices (SSMDs) in atopic dermatitis (AD) patients and other dermatological conditions as a new non-invasive system for future treatment and monitoring of disease gearing up towards preventive care. This idea and new technology are groundbreaking and radical. SKINDEV aims to make SSMDs generally applicable through innovative technologies like sensing applications in wearables and cameras providing at-home on-demand skin health information. SSMDs will be ideal for early detection and intervention of health hazards. In this Pathfinder project the focus is on interaction at three steppingstones (SS), towards a prototype SSMD with proof-of-concept for the coupling of sensing and actuation in Cutibacterium acnes (C. acnes) for AD-related inflammatory processes: SS1. Systems engineering to create a multi-scale computational model of AD pathophysiology; SS2. Genetic engineering to create sensing and actuation circuits in C. acnes; SS3. Tissue engineering to create a high throughput skin organoid platform for AD. A priority of SKINDEV is to translate technological innovations into proof-of-concept novel devices. SKINDEV is expected to invent such new technologies to i) genetically modify skin microbes, ii) create sensing modules and actuators, and iii) develop pre-clinical skin organoids and computational models for host-microbe interactions. The work plan implements an efficient ‘design, build, test and learn cycle’ to accelerate the achievement of sensing and actuating performance fulfilling relevant physiological roles. Successful achievement of these ambitious goals requires highly integrated interdisciplinary collaborations by scientists working at the forefront of relevant disciplines.	skin microbiome, microbial devices, synthetic biology, sensors	UNIVERSIDAD POMPEU FABRA	STICHTING RADBOUD UNIVERSITAIR MEDISCH CENTRUM, HEINRICH-HEINE-UNIVERSITAET DUESSELDORF	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101098826/program/43108390/details	
Pandemic literacy and viral zoonotic spillover risk at the frontline of disease emergence in Southeast Asia to improve pandemic preparedness (PANDASIA)	The PANDASIA project addresses the call by providing a framework that will increase our understanding of the biology of viruses with emerging infectious disease potential and their interaction with humans, animals and the environment and translating this understanding into proactive preventative actions. Such research is crucial for providing evidence-based knowledge and tools for better integrative public health measures for local and national actors. We will develop models to identify and predict drivers of disease emergence, which will be evaluated with real world data, refined and used to develop health and pandemic literacy intervention strategies that reduce risk of future viral emergence, thereby reducing the burden of zoonotic spillover to human health. Since pandemics arise at a local level it is important to engage with local communities and health, environment and agriculture authorities to improve their health and pandemic literacy to ensure adequate preparedness and vigilance for future spillover events and human, animal and environmental health threats. Understanding spillover dynamics and threats at local levels in emerging disease hotspot areas, such as Southeast Asia, is important for the European Union to improve preparedness and the ability to respond quickly to health emergencies and cross-border threats. The identified drivers are likely generalizable to other emerging infectious disease hotspots in the region and if successfully implemented in SE Asia could be adapted to other hotspot regions, such as in South America and Africa.

Biomarkers affecting the transition from cardiovascular disease to lung cancer: towards stratified interception. (PREVALUNG EU)	Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and lung cancer (LC) are leading causes of deaths and intertwined chronic inflammatory processes associated with metabolism reprogramming, clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP), intestinal dysbiosis, and maladaptive immunity. CVD prone-tobacco users exhibit a 1-2% yearly incidence of LC. Low dose computed tomography screening programs reduce LC mortality by 20%. Beyond epidemiological scores, risk identification, early cancer detection and interception are mostly based on cell autonomous approaches. Understanding pathophysiological failures linking CVD to LC would allow to take steps for prevention. Based on metabolo-metageno-proteo-immuno-gen-omics, our PREVALUNG prospective study conducted in CVD tobacco consumers allowed to unveil four drivers of early carcinogenesis leading to actionable biomarkers that can be harnessed to pioneer personalized interceptive measures. Four main objectives will be harnessed by 7 academic partners (transdisciplinarity and trialists in interception), 3 diagnostic Biotech Cies and one nutrition Foundation. First, refine and validate in retro- and pro-spective cohorts (>60.000), the 4 classifiers relying on the 4 inflammatory drivers (autophagy/innate immunity/intestinal barrier defects and CHIP) to implement patient stratification. Second, develop and validate robust friendly-user tools monitoring such biomarkers for routine risk assessment. Third, demonstrate the actionability of these biomarkers through a biologically-informed multi-arm randomised trial testing measures targeting each of the 4 main drivers of inflammation using food supplements or pharmacological agents (metformin, anti-NKG2A/PDL-1 Abs, IL-1 inhibitor, probiotics respectively) in addition to diet and life-style changes to return to homeostasis. Fourth, to adapt a secured interface between patients and clinical researchers using these new tools to the longitudinal monitoring of the interceptive measures.

Inflammation in human early life: targeting impacts on life-course health (INITIALISE)	The development of the human immune system in early life, including in utero, impacts the risks of several diseases later in life, particularly immune-mediated diseases such as allergies, asthma, and autoimmunity. Yet, the mechanisms of early life immune imprinting have been poorly understood in humans due to the difficulty in obtaining samples and the challenges of deriving the most important data from small sample volumes available. Furthermore, these studies are complicated by the many simultaneous exposures with potential impact on developing immune cells, colonising microbes, and immune-microbe mutualism. To better understand such interactions, a combinations of large population studies with longitudinal data and long-term follow-up and more detailed studies in smaller sets of children will be needed. Here we propose such a combined and interdisciplinary approach by intersecting multiple cohorts and existing biobanks, applying state-of the art technologies for exposure analyses and immune system investigation. This will enable us to understand the environmental factors shaping human immune systems early in life, their mechanisms of action, and impact on life-course health. The specific objectives of INITIALISE are: 1. to elucidate how exposures and genome impact gut microbiome, host immune system and metabolism, and how the interplay of these factors impact life-course health. 2. to define the role of the maturation of the immune system as a mediator between exposures and life-course health. Functional studies will be performed, to test specific mechanisms of environmental factors differing among children with different health outcomes and their imprinting on developing immune cells. 3. to perform a pilot clinical study, targeting the immune system, for personalised disease prevention. 4. to set up a collaborative data science platform for the studies of early-life factors linked with life-course health.

Integrating AI in Stroke Neurorehabilitation (AISN)	Health services are increasingly moving towards a treatment continuum aligned with the patient journey. This transition will critically depend on the successful deployment of trustworthy AI-enhanced technologies that are accurate, secure, and trusted. The AISN project will develop and validate operating procedures and guidelines for integrating AI in a healthcare continuum, focussing on post-stroke rehabilitation. AISN delivers a representative AI health platform built from integrating validated platforms for data acquisition and access, clinical interpretation, whole-brain simulation, clinically validated intervention delivery and optimization and model-based prediction. The AISN integrated platform will be validated in the clinical context of rehabilitation in the outpatient and at-home phase and facilitate a concrete assessment of the fundamental ways in which AI-enhanced clinical decision-support will change the care pathway and the formulation of novel AI compatible treatment guidelines. AISN ensures an ethical approach by developing legal and ethical guidelines for the robust, fair, and trustworthy deployment of AI in health and validating acceptance and transparency of its solutions. Building on the AISN platform, the project will test current standard operating procedures for integrating AI in health care and formulate and validate new ones where needed. The AISN guidelines and procedures will emphasize the evidence base and safety of clinical interventions, transparency, prognostics at varying time-scales, personalization of interventions, access to disease-specific information by clinicians, patients and their carers, and assure that the potential of AI is fully developed in the service of value-based medicine satisfying standards of security and safety. We will go beyond currently available guidelines and frameworks by emphasizing explainability, AI tools with evolving performance, and the dynamic interaction between users and algorithms.	stroke rehabilitation, artificial intelligence, machine learning, virtual reality, brain modelling, cloud computing, knowledge data base, whole brain simulation, virtual research environment,	STICHTING RADBOUD UNIVERSITEIT	SADDLE POINT SCIENCE EUROPE BV, EODYNE SYSTEMS SL, EBRAINS, MEDTRONIC IBERICA SA, TP21 GMBH, UNIVERSITAT WIEN, SAN CAMILLO IRCCS SRL, FUNDACIO PRIVADA PER A LA RECERCA I LA DOCENCIA SANT JOAN DE DEU, UNIVERSITE DE LIMOGES, CHARITE, Centre hospitalier universitaire de Limoges	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101057655/program/43108390/details	
THE URBAN BURDEN OF DISEASE ESTIMATION FOR POLICY MAKING (UBDPOLICY)	In Europe, more than 70% of the population lives in urban areas. Cities have long been known to be society’s predominant engine of innovation and wealth creation, yet they are also a main source of pollution, disease and mortality, which is to some extent linked to suboptimal urban and transport planning practices. The proposed work aims to improve the estimation of health impacts and socio-economic costs and/or benefits of environmental stressors, advance methodological approaches and foster their acceptance as common good practice for urban areas, to help strengthen evidence-based policy making at city, national and EU level. We will focus on nearly 1000 cities and environmental stressors including air pollution, noise, temperature/heat and lack of green space but we will also include physical activity as a main determinant of health and examine the effects of gender and inequality in the impact estimations. We aim to produce a system that will provide updates every 3 years to be able to monitor progress. It will extensively involve stakeholders and conduct knowledge translation. We will use transdisciplinary and systemic approaches bringing together a team of, amongst others, experts and practitioners in urban and transport planning, environment and public health, economics, retail and business, education sector, policy analysis, knowledge translation and involve citizens and NGOs.

Maximising Impact of Prescription Drugs in Rheumatoid Arthritis (SQUEEZE)	The SQUEEZE consortium comprehensively addressed how biomarkers can be used to optimize disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). RA is a chronic immune-mediated disease with enormous health-related quality of life and socioeconomic impact. A broad choice of DMARDs with different targets is up to date available in clinical care, however without sufficient markers indicating the best choice for a particular patient, treatment strategies can be ineffective, cumbersome and expensive. The team of leading academic centres with a first-class record in translational and clinical research, together with patients and small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) has set out to deliver a collaborative programme to advance the clinical application of biomarkers to improve benefit, safety, and value of approved DMARDs. SQUEEZE utilizes models from data science, clinical trials, translational science, and behavioural science to engage in a complementary, synergistic, and non-overlapping manner addressing the use of biomarkers to improve the ability to select the DMARD with the highest likelihood of fitting the immunophenotypic and clinical profile of the patient, to optimise dose and route of existing DMARDs; and to inform an innovative model of care focusing on patient´s preferences and needs to increase adherence to prescribed drugs. Through nine dedicated work packages SQUEEZE integrates to validate clinical, laboratory, molecular, digital and behavioural biomarkers to enable the recognition of patients with high likelihood of response to treatment and the selection of the drug with highest chance of benefit for an individual patient; and as such improve efficacy and safety of existing therapies (by squeezing the most out of existing drugs) in synergy with other EU-wide activities.

Adaptive virtualization for AI-enabled Cloud-edge Continuum (CloudSkin)	"As of today, 80% of the data processing and analysis occurs in cloud data centers, and only 20% of processing occurs at the edge. This incipient exploitation of edge resources increases time to value and prevents business processes, decisions, and intelligence to be taken outside of the data center, which prevents Europe to unlock an entire set of new opportunities to serve different industries and use cases in Europe in the next years. To help to materialize the European bid on a true continuum in the next few years, CloudSkin pursues to build a cognitive cloud continuum platform with three main innovations: 1. The CloudSkin platform will leverage AI/ML to optimize workloads, resources, energy, and network traffic for a rapid adaptation to changes in application behavior and data variability, re-configuraing the ""sweet spot"" between the cloud and the edge in the face of the rapid varying conditions; 2. The CloudSkin platform will also help users to achieve “stack identicality” across the Cloud-edge continuum, whereby the same (legacy) software stacks (e.g., MPI programs) running in data centers can seamlessly run at remote edges. The development of a new lightweight, portable virtualizaion abstraction will be paired with the development of new confidential abstractions to protect data while it is in use; and 3. CloudSkin will also contribute to prepare the needed infrastructure to integrate the new virtualized execution abstractions into the virtual resource continuum, particularly, for those Cloud-edge applications composed of small tasks with fast data access and sharing requirements. The infrastructure will expose the relevant control knobs to enable dynamic reconfiguration of resources as assisted by the AI/ML-based orchestration plane in the CloudSkin platform. Altogether, the above innovations are the strategic elements of what we envision as the new “cognitive continuum for the cloud and edge""."

New bio-based and sustainable raw materials enabling circular value chains of high performance lightweight biocomposites (R-LIGHTBIOCOM)	New lightweight High-Performance Composite (HPC) materials and efficient sustainable processing technologies will have an enormous environmental and performance benefit in all sectors of application. However, current sustainable HPC application is limited to large sectors due to their limitations in terms of long processing times, high prices and low recyclability. To overcome these limitations, r-LightBioCom propose a paradigm shift in the way HPC are manufactured and recycled, unlocking sustainable-by-design production of lightweight HPC. Therefore, the project will enable new circular value chains towards r-LightBioCom results, contributing to environmental-related EU goals and reducing the HPC waste generation and the use of non-sustainable fossil resources. To this end, a sustainable catalogue of new advanced biobased and recycled HPC materials will be initially developed with inherent recyclability properties (at least 3 new types of bio-resins, 4 new biomass-derived nanofillers and additives, and 3 families of sustainable fibre-based textile products). To reduce current associated manufacturing costs and high energy consumptions and emissions, efficient processing techniques will be developed (2 new fast curing techniques) combined with recycling technologies for the new catalogue of materials to reduce waste generation and induce circularity. A new open method and related tools (Coupled Ecological Optimisation framework) will promote and standardise holistic sustainable HPC design, modelling and systematic optimisation, leading to continuous sustainable catalogue growth and inclusion of new families of biobased, recyclable lightweight HPC at competitive cost. All results will be validated in 3 use cases at automotive, infrastructure and aeronautic industries with specific business cases, contributing to establishing new resilient, sustainable and innovative value chains in the EU HPC industry, promoting a change of paradigm from linear to circular ones.

DURABILITY MODELLING OF COMPOSITE STRUCTURES WITH ARBITRARY LAY-UP USING STANDARDIZED TESTING AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (D-STANDART)	Advanced composite manufacturing is becoming crucial in the global sustainable drive for a climate-neutral future as enabler of light-weight structures in, for example, the aerospace and wind energy sector. Their increased relevance has raised the importance of damage tolerance and durability of composite structures, currently dealt with time-consuming and inaccurate techniques. Hence the objective of D-STANDART is to develop fast and efficient methods to model the durability of large-scale composite structures with arbitrary lay-ups under realistic conditions (loads, environment). New test methodologies will be developed using generic specimens to correctly quantify material parameters that determine the durability of composites under cyclical loading. Material characterisation will be used in high-fidelity models to simulate defect growth in various lay-ups and at various scales as a function of cyclical loading and rate. To apply these models in an industrial design environment, D-STANDART will make use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) surrogate models, trained using test data from the project and historical test data to easily adapt to different design parameters and complex lay-ups, thereby accelerating the development, uptake, and commercialisation of advanced components. Two use cases have been selected to validate the modelled durability performance both in the aerospace and renewable energy sectors. Furthermore, circularity and sustainability will be assessed via dedicated life-cycle assessment, life cycle costing and cost-benefit analysis. This 36-month €5.6M valued action involves, 9 partners (3 universities, 2 RTOs, 2 industry, and 2 SMEs) from four countries (United Kingdom, The Netherlands, Germany, and France). The consortium will be supported by an Advisory Board formed of 6 End users embracing the value chain to validate requirements, guide on relevant approach to certification, and finally support results uptake, in tight alignment with EMCC.	fatigue, composites, durability, modelling, standardization, manufacturing, artificial intelligence, life cycle assessment	STICHTING KONINKLIJK NEDERLANDS LUCHT	UNIVERSITEIT TWENTE, TECHNISCHE UNIVERSITEIT DELFT, MSC SOFTWARE GMBH, L, SE BLADES TECHNOLOGY BV	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101091409/program/43108390/details	
Multi-layer governance performance of marine policies (PERMAGOV)	PERMAGOV aims to contribute to the realization of the EU Green Deal objectives by improving implementation and performance of EU marine policies. PERMAGOV’s project objectives are: 1) co-developing and applying a Marine Governance Performance Assessment Framework to assess how institutional barriers, formal and informal collaborations and e-governance tools enable and constrain the capability of actors to implement EU marine policies within the areas of Marine Energy, Maritime Transport, Marine Life and Marine Litter; and 2) co-producing Multi-Layered Collaborative Marine e-Governance Strategies which enhance the capability of end-users to contribute to the implementation of EU marine policies related to the four marine issue areas to achieve the EU Green Deal goals. PERMAGOV will contribute to the improved performance of marine polices and a successful implementation of the EU Green Deal objectives, by an assessment of 9 cases (De-carbonizing shipping, Motorways of the Sea (Maritime Shipping), Seabed integrity, Sustainable fisheries in MPAs (Marine Life), Floating Wind, Energy island, Offshore Wind (Marine Energy), Marine litter (Baltic and Mediterranean Seas)(Marine Plastics)), focusing on the enabling and constraining conditions of institutional barriers and the possibilities for multi-layered collaborative and e-governance. Characteristics for PERMAGOV is co-production and co-creation from the start to the end of the project and beyond. Together with end-users and stakeholders from maritime industries, NGOs, researchers and policymakers the Performance Assessment Framework will be developed and applied, in co-production the cases will be assessed, innovative Governance Strategies will be developed and digital tools will be improved in order to overcome the barriers hampering the performance of marine policies and the successful implementation of the objectives of the European Green Deal.

Youth co-Production for sustainable Engagement and Empowerment in health (YiPEE)	Most traditional youth mental health interventions fail to achieve sustainable impact at scale because they overly rely on individualized, medical illness-focused models and treat youth as passive beneficiaries. citiesRISE, a multi-stakeholder initiative founded in 2017 to address these gaps, has worked with youth, communities, and professionals across five cities, as well as social innovators in over twenty countries, to develop a set of evidence-based, scalable youth mental health interventions and implementation models. The YiPEE project aims to provide robust evidence on the feasibility, adaptability, effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness of a multi-component intervention targeting the inner, social, and environmental dimensions that underpin mental health and broader NCD risk reduction outcomes, when implemented using a youth-informed and -activated approach. This will be achieved through a a mixed-methods approach, conducting a realist evaluation across the four sites (Chennai, India; Nairobi, Kenya; Cape Town, South Africa; Stockholm, Sweden) to study key implementation outcomes following the Practical Robust Implementation and Sustainability Model (PRISM) as well as the mechanisms underlying why the intervention works, for whom, and under what real-world conditions. In Chennai, YiPEE will conduct a randomized controlled trial for more robust evaluation of effectiveness and cost-effectiveness in achieving key mental health and other NCD related lifestyle behavioral outcomes. YiPEE focuses on the combination of a school-based multicomponent intervention targeting positive disruption in the inner, social, and environmental dimensions of adolescents’ mental health and a youth-informed and -activated implementation model that puts young people at the centre of transformation, working collaboratively with a range of other stakeholders.	mental health, non-communicable diseases, youth-centered approach, mixed-methods, RCT	KAROLINSKA INSTITUTET	CITIESRISE INC, STELLENBOSCH UNIVERSITY, UNIVERSITEIT ANTWERPEN, TAMPEREEN KORKEAKOULUSAATIO SR	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101095659/program/43108390/details	
Real-world evidence for decisions in diabetes (REDDIE)	Randomised controlled trials are the cornerstone of evidence-based medicine. However, the digitisation of real-world data (RWD) including data from devices, wearables, and electronic health records in large national registries provides opportunities to demonstrate efficacy and safety of innovative technologies including drugs, devices, diagnostics, and digital health. These data are particularly relevant to long-term conditions such as diabetes mellitus, where drugs, lifestyle interventions, and digital technologies often work together. To better utilise RWD in diabetes for regulatory decision making, a development of standards, guidance, and an assessment of the efficacy to effectiveness gap is needed. REDDIE (Real-World Evidence for Decisions in Diabetes) aims to explore how RWD can complement RCTs to improve efficacy, safety, and value for money of technologies to prevent and treat diabetes. The overall aim of REDDIE is to support the use of RWD in diabetes and health-related research, which will maximise Europe’s scientific expertise and know-how to benefit people with diabetes, resulting in safer, more efficient, and cost-effective interventions. We thus aim to engage with stakeholders such as regulatory and HTA authorities and co-develop evidentiary standards for the collection, assessment, and acceptability of RWD. We will then develop and validate state-of-the art modelling techniques using synthetic data derived from large national registries to better assess outcomes of interventions using RWD. We will use data from four large national registries to elucidate the gap between outcomes in RCTs and RWD studies, and understand the factors that affect this gap. Finally, we will test the ability of machine learning to facilitate the better use of RWD. REDDIE will generate standards for RWD use for the evaluation of medicines and other interventions by regulatory authorities and HTA bodies.

Medical Integrated Photonic Ultrasound Transducer (Med-IPUT)	The multi-sensing 'Medical Integrated Photonic Ultrasound Transducer' (MED-IPUT) project will develop a high-resolution, high-quality, recyclable medical imaging system based on a disruptive integrated photonic ultrasound transducer concept. We envisioned a 100x increase in sensitivity compared to conventional US. The IPUT-based sensing system, combines optical waveguides and micromechanical membranes with two optical read-out techniques (RR and MZI) to at least two US applications; medical ultrasound (US) and photoacoustics (PA). We will solve technical challenges such as increasing sensitivity, mass parallelization by optical multiplexing and hybrid integration of microelectronics in PIC, tuneable waveguides, fiber chip coupling manufacturability and packaging. These advances will lead to a higher production yield and increased insight in the processing solutions of hybrid integrated photonics. The IPUTs are based on easily accessible materials, don’t require lead to improve the performance and laser power can be reduced significantly. We will iteratively develop an effective SOI and SiN manufacturing process to realize very sensitive IPUT sensors and integrate them into US transducer arrays for medical imaging and PA for validation and demonstration on phantoms instead of tissue. The partners have the in-house capability to develop, manufacture, integrate and package the novel IPUT-based sensing systems into transducers, covering the full manufacturing value chain. The increase in sensitivity will enable: 1. An increase of the US image by a factor 2. 2. An increase of the penetration depth by a factor 2. 3. A 100x reduction of the peak pressures. 4. A 100x reduction of the required laser power for PA resulting in the use of low-cost lasers. MED-IPUT reinforces European industrial leadership in high-performance multi-sensing system development and manufacturing, particularly in the healthcare sector.

Development of a multifunctional biomaterial patch for buccal delivery of peptide-analogue treatments (BUCCAL-PEP)	Oral delivery of peptide-analogues (a macromolecule) is one of the great challenges in pharmaceutical research. Thus far, only five peptide-analogues have been converted to oral formulations such as tablets/capsules and all face distinct challenges including low bioavailability, dosage control, patient administration inconvenience and restrictions in use (e.g. undesirable food interactions). The BUCCAL-PEP consortium will join hands to develop a multifunctional biomaterial patch which allows, for the first time, buccal (in the cheek) delivery of peptide-analogue therapies, thereby overcoming these challenges through unique integration of a permeation enhancer (SDC) with biomaterials and a peptide-analogue. The novel formulation enables peptides to diffuse across the mucosal multilayer, thereby effectively achieving their intended pharmacological response. The novel approach will result in an improved quality of patient life and increased treatment compliance. Within this project, the consortium will design, select and manufacture a lead product (with Type 2 Diabetes as showcase indication) that will be validated for performance in in vivo large animal studies. Additionally, a Health Technology Assessment will be performed to support the development an evidence-based value proposition and aid in the development of a commercialisation strategy. The final deliverable of the project is a patch that is pre-clinically validated and ready for clinical trials in the desired showcase indication. Overall, the BUCCAL-PEP project will provide a platform technology for oromucosal delivery of peptide-analogues that will be suitable for a broad range of experimental- and approved peptides-analogues therapies across a multitude of disease indications. BUCCAL-PEP will enable novel peptide-based treatments to emerge, which otherwise might not have reached the market due to incompatibility with the currently available administration routes.

Climate Neutral and Digitalized Laser Based Surface Functionalization of Parts with Complex Geometry (CLASCO)	In the coming years, the European industry must assume the challenge of adopting clean and climate-neutral industrial value chains, producing sustainable products. Adopting digital systems will radically change the industry with products and services through innovative production processes. In particular, fully digitalised laser-based additive manufacturing methods are very versatile and thus can be implemented in different industries. Furthermore, energy saves against conventional manufacturing and material waste but also by design optimization can be achieved. However, these parts also required of additional surface treatments, which are nowadays energy and material-consuming, increasing costs and harming the environment. In addition, new concepts for increasing the added value of AM parts must be developed, for instance, by producing advanced surface functionalities in critical applications. The main objective of the CLASCO project is to develop a universal and digitalised laser-based post-process route for creating functionalised AM parts with complex shapes. While the complex parts will be produced by Laser Powder Bed Fusion, Laser polishing and laser surface micro-structuring using Direct Laser Interference Patterning will be combined in a unique manufacturing system. This route will substitute several resource-consuming processes, reducing the environment's negative impact. The implementation will allow substituting standard environmental non-friendly methods and even obtaining a better performance. In addition, different in-line monitoring methods, specifically plasma sensors and infrared cameras will be implemented. In this way, a virtual representation of the process for each part will be possible (digital twin), creating an entirely digitised product. The project's impacts will be analysed to optimise the sustainability of processes and products across the entire life cycle.

Revolutionary high-resolution human 3D brain organoid platform integrating AI-based analytics (3D-BrAIn)	The long-term vision of the 3D-BrAIn consortium is to revolutionize personalized precision medicine for central nervous system (CNS) disorders, by developing an innovative bio-digital twin model of the human brain that is personalized, precise, and predictive. In this pathfinder project we bring together three breakthrough technologies: 1) a novel, highly reproducible human brain modelling technology using robust adherent iPSC-derived 3D cortical organoid cultures, 2) a unique, state-of-the-art 3D multi-electrode array (MEA) technology for non-invasive high-resolution electrophysiological recordings and 3) a novel approach to analyse and interpret the large quantities of functional data using tailored automated machine learning (ML)-based algorithms. With this breakthrough approach we overcome significant hurdles that made it thus far impossible to create a truly representative and functional model of the CNS for personalized medicine, drug screening and neurotoxicity testing. The revolutionary 3D-BrAIn high-precision CNS platform will allow robust and accurate modelling of the CNS for a broad range of neuropsychiatric diseases. Ultimately, the 3D-BrAIn technology will be translatable to multiple other organ systems (cardiomyocytes, pancreatic islets, retina), to non-invasively obtain longitudinal 3D high-resolution electrophysiological recordings and effectively interpret them. In this project a prototype of the 3D-BrAIn platform will be developed by growing functional 3D organoids that faithfully resemble the human cortex on 3D MEA micropillar electrodes, enabling continuous functional monitoring and by developing ML-based algorithms that can process and interpret the large spatiotemporal data sets. Once all individual components are optimized and integrated, proof-of-concept will be obtained by validating the platform for two of the envisaged applications: CNS drug development and neurotoxicity screening.	3D Brain organoids, microelectrode arrays, personalized precision medicine, artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning	ERASMUS UNIVERSITAIR MEDISCH CENTRUM ROTTERDAM	UNIVERSITA DEGLI STUDI DI GENOVA, MAX-PLANCK-GESELLSCHAFT ZUR FORDERUNG DER WISSENSCHAFTEN EV, LUDWIG-MAXIMILIANS-UNIVERSITAET MUENCHEN	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101098791/program/43108390/details	
Ionic Propulsion in Atmosphere (IPROP)	This project aims to bring ionic air-breathing propulsive systems beyond the pioneeristic phase, exploring their capabilities and improving their performance. Non-thermal plasma for atmospheric propulsion is a subject of recent investigations: model airplanes and vertical lifters have recently flown with this type of propulsion, but the potential of this technology is much higher. Many open aspects in this field deserve to be investigated, from fundamental research on ion production to geometric optimization of electrodes and integration of propulsion systems in existing aircraft. To this purpose, a complete research program is proposed, starting from breakthroughs in fundamental research to be achieved through theoretical, numerical and laboratory studies. The following steps will lead to develop improved and optimized propulsive units, with the objective of designing and building an airship model (technological demonstrator) with ionic propulsion. A further objective is the conceptual design of a full-scale stratospheric airship: for this aircraft the high risk approach of the project will give rise to different possible choices about propulsion, depending on the results achieved in the first steps. In particular, for this airship concept at least fully ionic propulsion and combined conventional/ionic propulsion will be considered. A major long-term impact is expected for ion-powered airships, which could act as stratospheric platforms replacing many satellite functions, such as telecommunications, remote sensing, disaster risk management in civil protection, offering these services at much lower costs, with the benefit of being recoverable systems. A fully successful program may lead to top-level, fully ion-powered airships: thanks to the propulsive units without moving mechanical parts, powered by solar energy, they would have extremely long operation times, low maintenance and very low pollution levels.	electrohydrodynamics (EHD), electroaerodynamics, ionized gas, ionic wind, corona discharge, EHD thruster, ionic propulsion, ionic air-breathing propulsion, ion-powered airship, stratospheric airship	POLITECNICO DI MILANO	ALMA MATER STUDIORUM, KARLSRUHER INSTITUT FUER TECHNOLOGIE, VON KARMAN INSTITUTE FOR FLUID DYNAMICS, INSTITUT SUPERIEUR DE L'AERONAUTIQUE ET DE L'ESPACE, CENTRE NATIONAL DE LA RECHERCHE SCIENTIFIQUE CNRS, AERONORD DI ENZO CISARO & C.

Artificial Placenta (ArtPlac) - Miniaturized Integrated Lung and Kidney Support for Critically Ill Newborns (ArtPlac)	This Pathfinder project will establish a radical change in the treatment of newborns using an artificial placenta (ArtPlac). What drives us towards a radical new treatment approach? 2 mio. neonatal deaths that occur worldwide yearly. The technological advancements of the last fifty years were based on scaling down adult devices which are not ideal for all babies. Why? Because babies are not just small adults! In fact, the applied treatments are very invasive and cause side effects by damaging their sensitive bodies. Survivors often suffer from life-long complications or cannot live independently. In utero, the placenta is a life-giving organ and serves as fetal lung, fetal kidney, and feeder. Because the placenta cannot be reconnected after preterm birth, we aim to continue the placental support with ArtPlac. Our novel device simply connects to the belly button for lung and kidney support while the newborn can breathe, mature, and heal. To achieve this, a novel compact and miniaturized all-in-one artificial placenta device combining lung and kidney functions will be developed. Our plug-in approach will use the natural umbilical vessels at the belly button with expandable catheters to provide a large bore vascular access like in utero. This allows ArtPlac to be driven solely by the newborn's heart like in the womb. Inline sensors will analyze blood parameters without painful collection. Feedback loops in ArtPlac will provide individual demand-driven support. Inbuilt features for hemocompatibility will prevent thrombosis and use of high-dose systemic anticoagulation with the high risk for brain bleeding. Importantly, ArtPlac allows family integrated care providing a therapy for the newborn in close connection to its family. In summary, our visionary approach revolutionizes the treatment of newborns after birth. It will reduce brain damage and comorbidities, promote long-term health, and therefore improve the survival chances of up to 1.2 mio. newborns per year.	neonatology, fetal medicine, artificial placenta, combined lung and kidney support device, oxygenator	KLINIKUM NURNBERG	UNIVERSITEIT TWENTE, KUNGLIGA TEKNISKA HOEGSKOLAN, DEUTSCHES HERZZENTRUM MUNCHEN, UNIVERSITEIT MAASTRICHT, FRAUNHOFER GESELLSCHAFT ZUR FORDERUNG DER ANGEWANDTEN FORSCHUNG EV, MAQUET CARDIOPULMONARY GMBH, EUROPEAN FOUNDATION FOR THE CARE OF NEWBORN INFANTS, ARROTEK MEDICAL LIMITED	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101099596/program/43108390/details	
Hyper-targeting CAR NK cells from induced pluripotent stem cells for novel off-the-shelf anti-tumor therapies (HyperTargIPS-NK)	The HyperTargIPS-NK project aims to combine novel technologies from three research laboratories and a stem cell company to develop a revolutionary therapeutic modality for patients with devastating refractory malignancies. The treatment we propose is based on allogenic transplantation of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell-derived natural killer (NK) cells, genetically modified to a hyperactive state to ensure high potency NK cell targeting and destruction of tumor cells. CAR NK-based cancer treatment is an extremely promising new therapeutic avenue. However, the full potential of CAR NK therapies will only be achieved when an off-the-shelf product is rapidly accessible to patients in need. IPS with its unlimited expansion potential is the ideal cell source for NK-based products, however, improved efficiencies of NK cell production, suitably activated status, and resistance to immune suppression would need to be achieved. We have several breakthrough technologies to address these issues with 1) a novel iPS cell differentiation system based on our newly identified metabolic regulators that can be easily scaled to generate billions of functional NK cells, 2) identified and validated several novel and state-of-the-art CAR, non-CAR and TRUCK based regulators of NK activation to elicit the hyper activated NK cell state and prolonging NK survival, and 3) improved NK response to tumors via tumor microenvironment remodeling. We will target the NK cells towards three life-threatening cancers for which novel treatment options are urgently needed as they are considered among the most lethal cancers; i.e. Pancreatic cancer, Glioblastoma, and Acute Myeloid leukemia (AML). Our iPS culture system, NK activation systems, and gene editing systems, have already been designed towards GMP compatibility. Taken together, these advances ensure that once this study is successful, our Hyper-Targ-IPS-NK cells are poised for rapid translation towards the clinic with our industrial partner.

Preterm Brain-Oxygenation and Metabolic EU-Sensing: Feed the Brain (Prometeus)	Prometeus introduces a new-paradigm for personalized nutrition of prematurely born neonates in neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), by developing a groundbreaking technology for real-time adjustment of glucose and nutrients intakes to target neonatal brain needs. The brain of a baby born prematurely is highly susceptible to early neonatal injuries that, in turn, increase the risk for neurodevelopmental disability. Provision of adequate nutrients and oxygen is essential for proper brain development and growth. However, current nutritional strategies are unfit to target real-time brain necessities, and are driven by pre-specified (non personalised) nutritional charts, in the absence of contemporary cot-side monitoring of both brain “health” and metabolic supplies. As a consequence, sudden changes of brain fuel-requirements cannot be promptly addressed by real-time adjustment of glucose and nutrients provision. Prometeus will develop a metabolic model of the interaction between the three key brain fuels [glucose, lactate and beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB)] and their effect on regional cerebral blood flow (CBF), oxygen saturation (StO2) and metabolism (CMRO2). The model will serve to individualize brain nutrition targeting “brain health” according to the inputs derived from two novel minimally invasive metabolic sensing systems: a wearable cap measuring regional CBF, StO2 and CMRO2 and a subcutaneous miniaturized metabolic sensor for glucose, lactate and BHB. The system will create a metabolic “womb” to feed the brain of preterm neonates. Prometeus will be paralleled by a parent-dedicated interface, exploiting a purposely developed family adjusted visual language, that will inform parents of preterm babies during their NICU admission and stay. Prometeus will dramatically reduce the risk for prematurity-associated disability in Europe and worldwide, with a consequent incalculable ethical, social and economic impact.	neonatal, glycemic control, brain oxygenation, cerebral blood flow, lactate-glucose-ketones sensor, digital twin, metabolic model, prematurity, visual culture, optical imaging device	UNIVERSITA DEGLI STUDI DI PADOVA	QULAB MEDICAL LTD., UNIVERSITAT DE GIRONA, POLITECNICO DI MILANO, PIONIRS SRL, FUNDACIO INSTITUT DE CIENCIES FOTONIQUES, DAVE SRL, UNIVERSITE GRENOBLE ALPES, UNIVERSITY COLLEGE CORK	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101099093/program/43108390/details	
3D Printing of Ultra-fideLity tissues using Space for anti-ageing solutions on Earth (PULSE)	Bioprinting in Space is one of the novel promising and perspective research directions in the rapidly emerging field of biofabrication. There are several advantages of bioprinting in Space. First, under the conditions of microgravity, it is possible to bioprint constructs employing more fluidic channels and, thus, more biocompatible bio-inks. Second, microgravity conditions enable 3D bioprinting of tissue and organ constructs of more complex geometries with voids, cavities, and tunnels. Third, a novel scaffold-free, label-free, and nozzle-free technology based on multi-levitation principles can be implemented under the condition of microgravity. The ideal Space bioprinters must be safe, automated, compact, and user friendly. Thus, there are no doubts that systematic exploration of 3D bioprinting in Space will advance biofabrication and bioprinting technology per se. Vice versa 3D bioprinted tissues could be used to study pathophysiological biological phenomena when exposed to microgravity and cosmic radiation that will be useful on Earth to understand ageing conditioning of tissues, and in space for the crew of deep space manned missions. In PULSE, we aim at developing a radical new bioprinting technology based on multiple levitation principles and to use Space as an accelerator of ageing on Earth. As a proof of concept study, we will use this newly developed bioprinting technology to create cardiac 3D in vitro models able to better mimic cardiac physiology compared to organoids. We will use such models to study cardiac ageing and test the efficacy of antiinflammatory/ anti-oxidative drugs with anti-ageing potential.	biofabrication; levitation; bioassembly; 3D in vitro models; cardiac biology	UNIVERSITEIT MAASTRICHT	OTTO-VON-GUERICKE-UNIVERSITAET MAGDEBURG, STUDIECENTRUM VOOR KERNENERGIE / CENTRE D'ETUDE DE L'ENERGIE NUCLEAIRE, SPACE APPLICATIONS SERVICES NV, IN SRL IMPRESA SOCIALE, MEDIZINISCHE UNIVERSITAT GRAZ, RD INNOVATION APS	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101099346/program/43108390/details	
Vibrations of viral particles scatter light (VIRUSong)	Viruses are nanoparticles with well-defined size, shape and elasticity in which acoustic waves are confined. This leads to the appearance of new vibration modes that correspond to the vibration of the virus particle as a whole object. The VIRUSong project aims at implementing and realizing a simple and radically new way to identify viral particles on the basis of these vibrations. Inelastic light scattering spectroscopy (Raman and Brillouin) is usually a tool of choice to measure these vibrations, but for viruses, the effective scattering cross section is small. To overcome this drawback, the VIRUSong project will mainly focus on a few viruses of different size and structure and two parallel strategies will be explored. (a) the coupling of viruses with nanoparticles of hard materials which are very simple nano resonators (NPRs). The project VIRUSong project aims at using them as antennas to collect and amplify the song of the virus particles (i.e. the vibrations of the virions). (b) the use of Stimulated low-frequency inelastic spectroscopy that will allow the label-free detection of any type of virus. To achieve these objectives, the project will analyze each selected familly of viruses to determine their composition, size, shape and mechanical properties. Finally, all this information will be correlated using artificial intelligence to identify a given virus based on its vibrational spectra. By pushing the current limits of stimulated inelastic light scattering spectroscopy, designing nanoparticle resonators (NPRs) and implementing efficient artificial intelligence models, this project aims to develop the proof of concept of a new technology capable of identifying viral particles by light in a few minutes, while achieving high selectivity (specific vibrational signature) and high sensitivity (down to the single viral particle).	nanoparticle vibration; inelastic light scatterings spectroscopy;virus mechanical properties;artificial intelligence	UNIVERSITE LYON 1 CLAUDE BERNARD	LYON INGENIERIE PROJETS, AGENCIA ESTATAL CONSEJO SUPERIOR DE INVESTIGACIONES CIENTIFICAS, RIJKSUNIVERSITEIT GRONINGEN, CENTRE NATIONAL DE LA RECHERCHE SCIENTIFIQUE CNRS, UNIVERSITAET SIEGEN, NOSTICS BV	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101099058/program/43108390/details	
European Clinical Research Alliance on Infectious Diseases - PRIMary care adaptive platform trial for pandemics and Epidemics (ECRAID-Prime)	European citizens affected by COVID-19 have been well-served by landmark clinical trials in hospitals that have found treatments that save many lives. However, there are fewer opportunities for people in the community to contribute to the urgent mission of finding treatments that speed recovery, and reduce the need for hospital admission in the first place. Evidence-based therapeutics for use in primary care have the potential for considerable reach and impact on individual suffering and functioning, as well as on the sustainability of health services. ECRAID-Prime, a European Adaptive Platform Trial (APT) of therapeutics for patients with COVID-19 and potentially COVID-like illness in primary care will build on many years of EU investment in infrastructure for primary care trials and a mature primary care research network that has pioneered novel, efficient, platform clinical trial designs. In the winter of 2022/23, respiratory viruses will be co-circulating and disease aetiology can’t be distinguished solely on clinical grounds. Treatments with potentially broad antiviral activity will be most beneficial if started early in the disease trajectory. For those treatments patients with syndromic COVID-like-illness might be included. ECRAID-Prime, with a focus on early phase studies of safety and efficacy of exciting candidate treatments for COVID-19 and COVID-like illness will be rapidly set up. Its goal is to test at least four candidate treatments, identifying suitability for inclusion in the next phases of research, and so leading to critical additions to the primary care therapeutic armamentarium against COVID-19 and COVID-like illness. ECRAID-Prime will additionally help complete the vison for a lasting, integrated, comprehensive and sustainable European clinical research preparedness and response capacity, Ecraid, that will provide a full, integrated suite of international priority clinical trials in intensive care units, hospital wards, and now in primary care as well.

Flat Bands for Quantum Metrology (FLATS)	The ultimate limit on the accuracy of any measurement is set by quantum mechanics, this also means that quantum effects can be used in metrology and sensing to go well beyond any classical approach. For classical systems, statistical error is proportional to 1/sqrt(N) with N the number of measured particles. Measurements in quantum systems can overcome this limit and reach the Heisenberg limit proportional to 1/N. However, quantum standards and sensors are challenging to put in practice and their working conditions are nowadays intrinsically incompatible (e.g. magnetic field and superconductivity). Therefore, limiting their reach in terms of users and their development as accurate and enhanced quantum technologies. The vision we propose in FLATS is to use twisted bilayer graphene as a multiphenomena platform to develop present electrical quantum metrology standards, working under compatible conditions, and to develop the new generation of metrological sensor, going beyond the International System of units (SI). Their common platform will allow their integration as a single multi-use on-chip quantum lab. To achieve this, we will first create a European twistronics plateform for an unprecedented control of the relative angular alignment between graphene/BN layers. We will develop novel and original quantum electrical standards with twisted heterostructures. Our on-chip metrological quantum lab also enables the implementation of metrological sensors beyond the SI. This will be the first step towards quantum-enhanced measurements for metrological applications.	metrology bilayer graphene flat bands mesoscopic physics	COMMISSARIAT A L ENERGIE ATOMIQUE ET AUX ENERGIES ALTERNATIVES	UNIVERSITE PARIS-SACLAY, LABORATOIRE NATIONAL DE METROLOGIE ET D'ESSAIS, LUDWIG-MAXIMILIANS-UNIVERSITAET MUENCHEN, UNIVERSITE CATHOLIQUE DE LOUVAIN, GESELLSCHAFT FUR ANGEWANDTE MIKRO UND OPTOELEKTRONIK MIT BESCHRANKTERHAFTUNG AMO GMBH	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101099139/program/43108390/details	
REPRESSIT: A novel class of clinical immune checkpoint inhibitors (REPRESSIT)	In the tumor microenvironment, continuous or “tonic” stimulation of T cells induces checkpoint signaling through inhibitory immune receptors (IRs). This phenomenon suppresses T cell function, contributing to an exhaustion phenotype and their consequent failure to eliminate cancer cells. Checkpoint blockade through IR-targeting antibodies (e.g. anti-PD-1, anti-CTLA-4) can partially reverse this process, and has revolutionized cancer immunotherapy. However, a large fraction of patients, e.g. with tumors that do not express IR ligands, do not benefit from this treatment. Thus, a large unmet need remains to be addressed. We aim to change the current ligand-centric “blockade” paradigm. The REPRESSIT platform technology developed herein will provide a radically new approach, through development of a novel class of ligand-independent checkpoint therapeutics. These Receptor Inhibition by Phosphatase Recruitment (RIPR) molecules recruit tyrosine phosphatases to the IR and shut down IR signaling, thereby reactivating exhausted T or NK cells to effectively clear cancer cells. The REPRESSIT consortium unites unique complementary expertise and models in IR biology, tumor immunology, protein engineering, biophysics and proteomics, to: 1) define the design principles of RIPR molecules against multiple checkpoint IR targets, 2) evaluate the IR mode of action of signal inhibition, 3) optimize RIPR molecule for their efficacy using preclinical cancer models, and 4) demonstrate in vivo proof-of-concept (PoC)), focusing on a highly-relevant panel of T and NK cell IRs known to display tonic signaling. REPRESSIT will deliver a technology platform for off-the-shelf RIPR designs targeting phosphotyrosine-carrying IR. This project will provide the foundation for our long-term vision of innovative immune checkpoint therapeutics with unprecedented efficacy and provide a greatly improved perspective to the many cancer patients for which current treatment is ineffective.

Nanomedicine Approach to Normalize Erythrocyte Maturation in Congenital Anemia by messenger RNA (NANEMIAR)	Messenger RNA (mRNA) has recently proven itself as a prophylactic modality that can be rapidly developed and employed with high efficacy and low toxicity. Compared to DNA-based gene therapy, mRNA has significant advantages including higher intrinsic safety (non-integrating), lower cost of development, and less stringent regulatory requirements for clinical approval. In the NANEMIAR project, we take advantage of these benefits to kill 2 birds with 1 stone: first, we develop a first-of-its-kind nanomedicine for congenital anemia, a group of rare, inherited blood disorders characterized by ineffective red blood cell production. Our proposed bone marrow-targeted mRNA-based therapy contributes to the first Horizon Europe strategic plan (2021-2024) for new and advanced therapies for non-communicable diseases and is expected to be a vast improvement over current treatment options in terms of efficacy and safety. Second, we provide critical knowledge on targeted non-viral polynucleotide delivery, with a platform that can be exploited for next-generation cell and gene therapy in a broader context. To achieve this, our consortium combines the unique cell-targeting and mRNA knowledge from the Dutch Biotech Mercurna with two excellent research partners (from Spain and France) who have demonstrated expertise in the field of anemia. By focusing on the well-recognized rare disease model, beta-thalassemia, and combining an established mouse model, patient material, and previous drug development experience we build a convincing case to treat congenital anemia.	mRNA, erythropoiesis, lipid nanoparticles, targeting, health, congenital anemia	FUNDACION PARA LA FORMACION E INVESTIGACION SANITARIAS DE LA REGION DE MURCIA	MERCURNA BV, CENTRE NATIONAL DE LA RECHERCHE SCIENTIFIQUE CNRS	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101080156/program/43108390/details	
A revolutionary cell programming platform based on the targeted nano-delivery of a transposon gene editing system (NANO-ENGINE)	Aim: The NANO-ENGINE project aims to develop a first-in-class, DNA-based, non-viral, targeted in vivo cell programming technology that can be utilized for treating a broad range of diseases, including cancer and genetic disorders. In this project, the consortium aims to assemble, characterize, and test the Targeted Nanoparticles, explore small-scale synthesis, conduct proof of concept studies and develop a preliminary business plan. Unmet need: Currently, the accessibility of cell therapies, specifically CAR-T cell therapy, to the general patient population is limited by high costs, complexity, and safety concerns. These limitations are caused by: 1) ex vivo manufacturing processes of adoptive cell technologies, 2) requirement of highly specialized clinical facilities, and 3) the clinical toxicities and the need for preconditioning chemotherapy. Therefore, there is a large unmet need for alternative approaches that makes adoptive cell therapy truly affordable, scalable, and widely accessible in an out-patient setting. Solution: We will develop Targeted Nanoparticles that form CAR-T cells in vivo, by combining a proprietary T cell binder-coated long-circulatory lipid nanoparticle and a non-viral, transposon-based, gene editing system. As such, we will circumvent the aforementioned issues associated with traditional cell therapies with reduced cost, complexity, and associated clinical risks, greatly increasing the accessibility of cell therapies to patients worldwide. Consortium: The consortium will leverage main applicant NANOCELL’s deep knowledge on non-viral gene transfer technologies. UU provides critical expertise on nanomedicine, protein and cell engineering. ICL has developed a revolutionary single particle analysis method, which allows the consortium to obtain unique drug product characterization insights. SINTEF adds crucial know-how on bulk analysis of Targeted Nanoparticles, and is closely involved in regulatory standards for nucleic acid therapeutics.

NANOMEDICINE FOR ORGAN TRANSPLANTATION TOLERANCE (PHOENIX) (PHOENIX)	PROBLEM: Today, organ transplant medicine is limited by life-long immunosuppression and vulnerability to infections, malignancies and cardiovascular diseases, and by a 20% rate of long-term graft failure. SOLUTION: PHOENIX reprograms the local immune micro-environment around a graft organ, inducing long-term transplant tolerance without broader systemic immunosuppression. FOUNDATIONS: Our expert teams have already discovered novel peptide-MHC complex-based nanomedicines for the treatment of autoimmune diseases. This project will transform, deploy and validate this nano-technology platform for transplant medicine. We have unique expertise in kidney and liver murine transplant models as well as liver transplantation in pigs and have established a molecular engineering pipeline for immune-protein synthesis to enable future clinical translation. Extensive clinical-trial expertise will enable us to progress efficiently from this project towards the clinic. WORKPLAN: We are designing and building a unique nanomedicine which delivers ubiquitous or self-antigens - common to all humans – that will redirect the host immune response against the graft toward regulation and tolerance development. These medicines will be demonstrated in murine and porcine models, laying the foundation for human clinical trials immediately post-project. SUMMARY: This project combines innovative multi-disciplinary approaches, building on a proven foundation, to deliver a novel therapy which will have a transformative positive effect on organ transplant patients and healthcare.	immunology, nanotherapy, organ transplant, reprogramming the immune response	ISTITUTO DI RICERCHE FARMACOLOGICHE MARIO NEGRI	FUNDACIO DE RECERCA CLINIC BARCELONA-INSTITUT D INVESTIGACIONS BIOMEDIQUES AUGUST PI I SUNYER, CENTRE HOSPITALIER UNIVERSITAIRE DE RENNES, PINTAIL LTD	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101076383/program/43108390/details	
Versatile printed solutions for a safe and high-performance battery system (VERSAPRINT)	In order to boost the transition to a climate neutral transport sector, VERSAPRINT will bring innovations to the battery system to tackle safety issues, enhance performances as well as decrease cost and environmental impact. The VERSAPRINT technical solutions will be achieved mainly by 2D/3D printing directly on battery components and will operate from the heart of the battery system (i) providing an efficient cell thermal regulation in order to reduce risk of Thermal Runaway (TR) and increase density and lifetime; (ii) significantly improving the system thermal and safety management thanks to in operando sensoring; (iii) adding thermal and safety-oriented functionalities on busbars; (iv) allowing easy and safe dismantling and re-manufacturing; (v) lowering the casing’s weight, without losing its capability to contain TR and while ensuring good recycling rate; (vi) providing an advanced thermal/fire response; and (vii) controlling the exhaust gases released during a TR by cooling and evacuating them safely. VERSAPRINT will also implement a Decision Tool in order to choose the most optimised configuration for a given end application and will provide a validation at TRL5 (i) at module level with two module prototypes (for automotive and aeronautics) as well as one virtual module prototype (for waterway transport); (ii) at system level through simulation for all these applications. Other applications such as bus, non-road mobile machinery and stationary storage will be explored as well, through simulation. VERSAPRINT aims to reach the cost and performances targeted in Batteries Europe 2030 KPIs, while increasing module density by 5% and significantly improving the battery system fire resistance and safety (no fire outside module during TR). Sustainability will be assessed at all development stages.

NExt-generation MOdels for advanced battery electronics (NEMO)	NEMO project aims at advancing the state of the art of battery management systems (BMS) by engaging advanced physics-based and data-driven battery models and state estimation techniques. Towards achieving this goal, the consortium tends to provide efficient software and hardware to handle, host, process, and execute these approaches within high-end local processors and cloud computing. NEMO benefits from a wide range of sensor information acquired at high frequencies in addition to dedicated electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) sensors which allow for the identification of ongoing electrochemical reactions inside each individual battery cell. Capable hardware for storing and processing such measurements will be provided by the tier1 members of this industry onboard the consortium. The availability of such diverse physical information on batteries onboard makes room for developing cutting-edge performance, lifetime, and safety battery models and state estimators within NEMO, and validating them on two different BMS configurations. Physics-based performance model parameters continuously get updated as the battery ages, so that performance and safety state indicators maintain the least possible error. The data-driven approaches exploit mathematical algorithms to be trained upon the large datasets made available from historical or laboratory-generated battery information. Combinations of coupled physics-based and data-driven approaches are also foreseen to be implemented within NEMO as another innovation of the project to propose next-generation BMS. Solutions offered by NEMO considerably extend battery life and make the battery system safer within long-term operation since every individual cell is monitored, controlled, and studied. NEMO’s ambitious solutions for stationary and automotive use cases are expected to be validated by industrial partners and to take a considerable share of the market in later years.

Accelerated Cell- and Battery Testing (AccCellBaT)	Today’s battery development is impeded by a lack of virtualization, resulting in cost-and time-intensive physical verification and validation (V&V) activities. AccCellBaT addresses these shortcomings by substantially advancing virtualization, front-loading, and continuous V&V in future technology battery development to optimize battery design, cost, and time-to-market. Focusing on beyond state-of-the-art cell chemistry, novel physics-based and data-driven simulation models are developed to determine performance, lifetime, reliability, and safety of battery sub-systems. To ensure model applicability and high confidence, these models are accompanied by novel in-live model parameter measurement techniques, and by upscaling methods to scale cell models up to battery system models. Models and measurement data are synthesized to digital twins to be utilized in V&V. To advance front-loading, tests of these digital twins are merged with physical tests in a novel hybrid design verification and validation plan (hybrid DVP) methodology. To objectively quantify and ensure the confidence of test results, a tailored confi-dence index methodology for approval of the hybrid DVP is introduced. Based on Systems Engineering principles, processes and methods currently used by AccCellBaT consortium members are combined with the hybrid DVP and optimized to create a process-and-method manual applicable for future battery development. These building blocks of the full AccCellBaT methodology are implemented in a development tool, which provides an inte-grated development environment for management, planning and execution of battery V&V. The tool supports practitioners in development and significantly increases the level of process automation.To ensure validity and applicability of the AccCellBaT methodology across industries, the methodology is validated by two original equipment manufacturers (representing via automotive and stationary application a crucial share on battery system market).

ATomicallY Precise nanorIbbons QUAntum pLatform (ATYPIQUAL)	ATYPIQUAL’s main objective is to unveil a room temperature quantum technology platform based on a novel generation of Atomically Precise graphene nanoRibbons (APRs) and demonstrate its feasibility through technologically relevant devices. By definition, quantum technologies exploit the peculiar quantum properties of matter such as superposition, tunneling, and entanglement to develop tools and devices with new, non-classical functionalities. However, derived using conventional top-down techniques, these technologies lack atomic precision and are much more sensitive to environmental disturbances as compared to the electrical current switching in transistors. As such, they often require ultra-low temperature operation and impose important constraints on their general applicability. This makes their manipulation and integration to chip-scale substrates a major challenge. ATYPIQUAL is a highly interdisciplinary project that proposes a radically different high-risk bottom-up approach that uniquely offers to naturally 'hard-wire' complex quantum states into atomically precise carbon nanostructures: APRs. They exhibit novel physical properties beyond graphene such as topological quantum phases and spin polarization, all tailorable by their topology and edge structure. However, the demonstration of these electronic properties requires atomic precision control that can only be achieved through recent advances in bottom-up synthesis. We shall exploit atomically precise bottom-up on-surface synthesis to develop these novel advanced APRs offering on-demand multi-functionalities while relying on a single graphene nanoribbon backbone. By developing the required material processing and device fabrication steps and demonstrating the first technologically relevant feasibility examples, ATYPIQUAL will set the stage for a new quantum technology platform for atomically tunable multifunctional devices with applications in next-generation electronics, photonics and spintronics.

Research and development of a highly automated and safe streamlined process for increased Lithium-ion battery repurposing and recycling (REBELION)	The increasing e-mobility will trigger a battery waste problem (9Mtons/year by 2040) despite that many of the used LIBs are suited for 2nd-life applications for an additional 10 years, representing an opportunity to diminish energy and raw materials dependencies in Europe. Technical hurdles are preventing the re-use and recycling of Li-ion batteries. Besides the heterogeneity of the battery stock, assessing their condition for further usage is a slow process performed with equipment not suited for industrial contexts while. Dismantling packs and modules is in addition a costly and slow manual process because its automation faces extremely complex, multi-scale, cluttered and densely packed environments. REBELION will validate two circular schemes (including Light e-vehicles) to maximise 2nd life utility and domestic applications, enabled by a disruptive fast battery testing based on Electronic Noise Analysis, and an autonomous pack and module disassembly system with re-configuring capabilities for the ongoing battery types and formats. Additionally, a novel labelling system supported with blockchain, digital battery passport and ecolabel technology will provide key information to dismantlers, recyclers, re-manufacturers and users. Processing large volumes of used batteries increases the risks of thermal runway incidents, requiring thus novel safety protocols and systems. REBELION will add thermal monitoring and the design of a smart container for storage and transportation with thermal and gas sensing layers to monitor the limiting oxygen index and lower explosive limits, and a cooling system that activates when thresholds are surpassed. REBELION consortium covers all the value chain, including advanced robotic line and car manufacturer, bringing key knowledge, proprietary technology, and pilot validation facilities. The combination of 4 research centres and 7 industrial partners will ensure technology transference from lab to industrial context.

Decipher cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs) by digital tools to produce flavonoids and terpenoids (deCYPher)	Microbial production of plant metabolites has economic & environmental benefits over traditional extraction and chemical methods. Despite initial progress & the successful market introduction of some molecules, the microbial production of oxygenated plant metabolites (OPMs) mediated by cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs) is still lagging, making them almost inaccessible to society. In contrast, artificial intelligence (AI) & machine learning (ML) tools are evolving rapidly, but their use for engineering biology is still underexplored. deCYPher applies these groundbreaking AI/ML techniques to unlock the OPM molecules to society. deCYPher develops a standardised AI/ML pipeline to implement AI/ML in each step of the Design-Build-Test-Learn cycle, and across all steps in the biotech value chain. Combined with smart databases & synthetic biology (SynBio) tools, this AI/ML pipeline will generate opportunities for the whole biotech sector. Specifically, applied to OPMs, we (1) bioprospect & select specific CYPs, (2) correctly localise & express CYPs and (3) optimise the microbial cells & bioprocess. deCYPher involves stakeholders (industry, regulators, NGOs) and engages European citizens across several countries. This allows to reflect on the societal ramifications of the convergence of AI & SynBio. The consortium brings together complementary expertise from 5 top RTOs, 3 SMEs, 1 LE & 1 bio-art association from 6 EU countries to unlock the full potential of OPMs. In parallel, deCYPher will enable the AI/ML sector to apply their tools in the biotech sector, by creating new production tools for industrial biotech and specifically impact industry (flavours & fragrances, phytonutrient) and society with novel products. deCYPher contributes to the EU green deal, supports the transition to a circular bioeconomy, increases resource efficiency, strengthens European competitiveness, innovates in a responsible and reflective manner & boosts sustainability of biobased value chains.	learning techniques, synthetic biology, functionalisation, oxygenated plant metabolites	UNIVERSITEIT GENT	STICHTING WAGENINGEN RESEARCH, AGENCIA ESTATAL CONSEJO SUPERIOR DE INVESTIGACIONES CIENTIFICAS, ISOBIONICS B.V., SKYHAUS, SUOMEN BIOTAITEEN SEURA RY, BIOFACTION KG, LANTANA BIO, VIB VZW, BARCELONA SUPERCOMPUTING CENTER CENTRO NACIONAL DE SUPERCOMPUTACION	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101081782/program/43108390/details	
Ecology and biology of HPAIV H5 (Kappa-Flu) (Kappa-Flu)	The global emergence of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses and the subsequent adaptation to wild birds has resulted in record mortality of wild birds and poultry and is developing into an enzootic threat for wildlife, poultry and human health in Europe. The ongoing evolution of HPAI viruses is expanding their geographical distribution and host range. To deal with this global problem, KAPPA-FLU brings together top experts from Europe, North America and Asia. The overall objective of KAPPA-FLU is the characterization of key viral, host-related and environmental factors that determine the maintenance and the long-distance spread of HPAI viruses in wild birds, with the goal of improving capacities for risk-based surveillance, prevention and control of HPAI in poultry and wildlife, and its potential impact on human health. KAPPA-FLU will follow three research themes. Theme A (Disease ecology) provides a deep understanding of the population dynamics of HPAI viruses in migratory waterbirds and spill-over hosts, both resident wildlife and poultry, through risk-based surveillance strategies, and accounting for the impact of climate change. Theme B (Virology) studies the evolution of HPAI viruses in wild birds and poultry and the resulting increasing risk to humans and other mammals. Based on the above results, theme C (Agro-ecosystem risk) identifies and models prevention and control strategies (including vaccination) using machine learning algorithms. Actors from different sectors of society will, through the Multi-Actor Panel, play key roles in translating results into policy and practice. In this way, KAPPA-FLU will make stepwise advances in knowledge of the population dynamics and evolution of HPAI, and thus contribute to a sustainable poultry production system and improved public health.	highly pathogenic avian influenza, surveillance, virology, wild birds, poultry welfare, mammalian health, spill-over, environment, food safety, agro-ecosystem, risk assessment, control strategies	FRIEDRICH LOEFFLER INSTITUT	ERASMUS UNIVERSITAIR MEDISCH CENTRUM ROTTERDAM, LINNEUNIVERSITETET, ISTITUTO ZOOPROFILATTICO SPERIMENTALE DELLE VENEZIE	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101084171/program/43108390/details	
A dynamic, ultra-stable, random-access RNA retrieval database (DURA-store)	In order for DNA to become the information storage medium that serves as an alternative to existing digital storage solution technologies information must be stored stably in it with the means to repeatedly access and manipulate parts of the stored data. Only few in vitro approaches are capable to address some of these requirements, while in vivo approaches still produce largely static data storage libraries, which limits the real-life applicability of these technologies. In this proposal we present a new, regeneratable solid state storage system consisting of beads, where information, encoded in single stranded DNA strands, can be added, selectively accessed and removed using enzymes and nucleic acid strands as inputs for the different data operations in isothermal reactions with no loss of material. To achieve this a strand architecture is proposed, where unique Data ID sequences are used on the targeted data strands for performing the intended data operations via enzymatic reactions: addition, deletion of data and transcription-based data access. Furthermore, a variant of this system is proposed that uses RNA molecules for the selective access of the data strands, which we aim to implement in a bacterial data storage system as well where RNA encoding bacteriophages will be used as a non-invasive way to introduce inputs for the data operations, such as random data access and removal. Finally, we present the use of damage suppressor proteins from extremotolerant organisms complementing the in vitro and in vivo system to provide the long-term stability of DNA observed in resilient biological systems.

Low and very-low-field 3D magnetic resonance spirometry for advanced regional exploration of respiratory diseases (V-LF-Spiro3D)	Lung function is a central concern in the fight against covid-19. Beyond the pandemic heavy losses and long-term health implications, respiratory diseases represent a major threat for the World Health Organisation. It is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, associated to our way of living and impacting all of society. Current tools for diagnosing and monitoring pulmonary conditions are hindered by poor sensitivity (lung function tests), radiation exposure (computed tomography) or examination cost (magnetic resonance imaging, MRI). They all differently fail to fully assess lung structure and function V|LF-Spiro3D aims at democratizing newly developed and breakthrough 3D MR spirometry with high performance, low-cost MRI techniques to provide a ten-minute morphofunctional MRI protocol to engage patients in a safer, easier and more comfortable way. Based on recent works at Universities Paris-Saclay and Aberdeen, in collaboration with leading MR manufacturer Siemens, SME NMR Service, major French-Dutch hospitals and patient organisations, V|LF-Spiro3D brings together multidisciplinary experts in a patient-oriented approach for both adults and children V|LF-Spiro3D will redesign current MRI architecture to perform 3D MR spirometry at low and very low field. High-performance MRI hardware will be developed with accelerated acquisitions and coupled reconstruction strategies relying on deep learning. Biomechanical lung modelling and deep data processing will be guided by implementation of 3D MR spirometry in clinical facilities to produce unprecedentedly large sets of normative and training data covering six major respiratory diseases By prioritizing both technology transfer and innovation, V|LF-Spiro3D aims to build up a one-stop-shop imaging standard for unrestricted assessment of lung pathophysiology.

Immunopeptidomics-based Development of Next-Generation Bacterial mRNA Vaccines (BAXERNA 2.0)	BAXERNA 2.0 will establish a new vaccine development pipeline based on dramatically improved immunopeptidomics screening and innovative mRNA vaccine formulation. We will use our powerful new pipeline to develop novel mRNA vaccines against three bacterial pathogens that can persist within phagocytic cells: Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), Mycobacterium ulcerans (MU), and Acinetobacter baumannii (AB). MTB and AB are clinically problematic bacteria with alarming levels of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), while MU is an important neglected tropical disease. Although vaccines are recognized as highly effective tools to mitigate AMR and tropical diseases, effective vaccine development for these (facultative) intracellular bacteria is held back by a lack of known antigens, and by current vaccine platforms struggling to elicit the required strong cellular immune responses. We will overcome both limitations here through two key innovations: (i) novel proteomics and proteomics informatics approaches for immunopeptidomics to allow highly sensitive discovery and prioritization of bacterial epitopes presented on infected cells; and (ii) novel mRNA vaccines to induce both humoral and cellular immune responses, with innovative adjuvants to strengthen adaptive immunity, and to modulate innate immunity. Vaccine production will be done according to GMP standards, and we will pursue novel, low-cost production methods to enable local production and much-needed improved vaccine stability. We will characterize innate and adaptive immune responses in detail in human cellular models and mouse infection models. In addition, top vaccine candidates for MTB will be evaluated in unique primate models, followed by testing of the lead candidate in a first-in-human Phase I clinical trial. Together, we will establish our novel vaccine development pipeline as a blueprint for world-leading, next-generation bacterial vaccine development.

INNOVATIVE NASAL VACCINES TO PREVENT PATHOGEN COLONIZATION AND INFECTION IN THE UPPER RESPIRATORY TRACT (NOSEVAC)	Bacterial and viral respiratory infections are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Streptococcus pneumoniae and Bordetella pertussis, influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2, are responsible for diseases with major public health impact: community-acquired pneumonia, whooping cough, influenza and COVID-19, respectively. Vaccines against some of these diseases, administered by intramuscular or subcutaneous injection, do not prevent colonization or infection of the upper respiratory tract (URT), and therefore have limited impact on pathogen transmission. The NOSEVAC consortium aims to develop and assess innovative nasal vaccine platforms as a novel concept to block the earliest stage of infection, thereby inhibiting URT colonisation, transmission and disease. The project builds on a unique consortium of 12 renowned and complementary teams from the EU, UK and Switzerland. NOSEVAC’s objectives are to: • Develop vaccine formulations for nasal delivery of RNA- and protein-based antigens • Discover bacterial antigens that promote colonization of the URT • Use a combination of in vitro and in vivo models for optimal evaluation of vaccines efficacy • Identify key host immune factors required for long-term protection of the URT in human • Deliver two nasal vaccine candidates to fight S. pneumoniae and B. pertussis infection, and a single bivalent vaccine to prevent influenza and COVID-19 • Address acceptability of nasal vaccination Expected outcomes include (1) strengthening innovation in Europe by enriching the pipeline for novel vaccines against (new) respiratory infections, (2) increasing knowledge on the mechanisms underlying URT colonization, infection and immunity, and (3) evaluating nasal vaccine acceptability by stakeholders. NOSEVAC will develop strategic research avenues to fight respiratory pathogens including those with epidemic potential and will facilitate evidence-based decision making to policy makers and investors.

Gene Therapy for treatment of rare inherited Arrhythmogenic Cardiomyopathy (GEREMY)	Development of a cure for rare cardiac diseases is a risky, costly and time-consuming process, which is hampered by insufficient insight into pathophysiological mechanisms of the diseases and lack of relevant disease models. The GEREMY consortium proposes to overcome this challenge by developing a gene therapy (GT) for inherited arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (ACM), by targeting the disease-causing PLN (non-desmosomes) and PKP2 (cardiac desmosomes) mutations. The GEREMY consortium will apply a unique parallel approach and investigate various promising GT approaches (oligonucleotide chemistries, gene editing and gene delivery). Also, the consortium will engineer disease models for proper assessment of therapeutic interventions and aims to provide in vitro & in vivo preclinical proof-of-concept for the GT. A significant benefit compared to current technologies is that the GT has the potential to be a curative treatment for rare cardiac diseases. Based on previous successes, GEREMY will target PLN & PKP2 as a roadmap of the technology. Restoring the primary defect in the PLN & PKP2 genes that cause the disease will lead to preserving or even restoring myocardial contractility. Through this approach, GEREMY will work towards a curative treatment of inherited ACM and likely other cardiomyopathies, which significantly reduces the healthcare burden. The project’s experts in preclinical research and cardiac genetics will deliver preclinical efficacy and safety data for the mutation correction. The partners with regulatory and clinical trial expertise (EXOM, EUF, NLHI) will prepare for immediate start of clinical trials upon project completion, and apply for orphan drug designation. EUPATI, a patient organisation and KUL ethics partner will ensure that the project is continuously aligned with patient needs and ethical perspectives. The whole consortium will contribute to communicate an disseminate the results to ensure maximum exploitation of this breakthrough technology.	cardiomyopathies, PLN, PKP2, oligonucleotide chemistries, gene editing and gene delivery, patient engagement.

Novel advanced and repurposed therapeutics for vision restoration in a group of severe rare ocular surface diseases: from validation to first clinical investigations (RESTORE VISION)	Rare Eye Diseases (REDs) are a major cause of visual impairment and blindness in Europe, affecting patients of all ages. The RESTORE VISION Consortium identified a group of 7 REDs all affecting the cornea and ocular surface that cause severe vision impairment and blindness and have inadequate treatment options today. Onset and progression is characterised by overlapping common pathophysiologic mechanisms: defective corneal wound healing, nerve degeneration, stem-cell dysfunction and aberrant vessel ingrowth. The 7 REDs targeted are Aniridia-Associated Keratopathy, Neurotrophic Keratopathy, Limbal Stem Cell Deficiency, Ocular Cicatricial Pemphigoid, EEC Syndrome, Ocular Graft versus Host Disease and Corneal Neovascularisation, affecting over 500k patients in Europe. Current management is often prohibitively expensive, has low efficacy and leads to debilitating side effects, pointing to a critical medical problem and area of unmet medical need. RESTORE VISION brings together actors from across the full value chain: 6 leading research institutions, 3 SMEs and a European patient organisation. We take a ground-breaking approach to improve eye health by verifying disease pathomechanisms, using cutting-edge models for each rare disease to test novel and repurposed compounds and determine drug mechanisms of action, formulating compounds as safe eye drop suspensions or subconjunctival drugs, and performing several first-in-human trials of novel therapies. New therapeutics with game-changing potential will be evaluated for the first time. Our pioneering ‘streams’ approach is based on the repurposing of 6 existing drugs and the development of 3 new compounds, all with solid preliminary data showing remarkable effects in restoring the cell physiology, immune, avascular, neural and signalling environment in the cornea. This innovative approach shortcircuits lengthy and complex regulatory and drug development processes, ensuring rapid translation into the clinic.	cornea, rare eye disease, stem cells, stem cell deficiency, nerve regeneration, wound healing, aniridia, neurotrophic keratopathy, graft versus host disease	NATIONAL UNIVERSITY OF IRELAND GALWAY	LINKOPINGS UNIVERSITET, OSPEDALE SAN RAFFAELE SRL, UNIVERSIDAD MIGUEL HERNANDEZ DE ELCHE, INSTITUT NATIONAL DE LA SANTE ET DE LA RECHERCHE MEDICALE, KLINIKUM DER UNIVERSITAET ZU KOELN, CELL2CURE APS, ANIRIDIA EUROPE, LABORATOIRES KOL, Catalyze B.V.	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101080611/program/43108390/details

A clinical research network to improve the management of Monkeypox virus disease (MPX-RESPONSE)	The 2022 Monkeypox outbreak is unprecedented in scale and cases are still active in South America and starting to appear in South-East Asia. Many questions about Monkeypox virus disease remain unanswered to this day, particularly concerning the management of patients. MPX-RESPONSE aims to increase our knowledge of the monkeypox virus disease, to improve its therapeutic management and to further inform public health policies and guidelines through four Work Packages (WP). WP2 (MOSAIC) will assess clinical and virological outcomes of Monkeypox patients treated or not with antiviral drugs, focusing treatment on the most severe cases. WPs 3 and 4 will conduct randomized clinical trials (RCT) with the most promising antiviral therapy, tecovirimat, targeting patients in Europe (WP3-EPOXI) and globally in collaboration with WHO (WP4-UNITY); particularly in mild and moderate cases. A common primary outcome will be shared between the two RCTs and EPOXI will include additional objectives regarding pharmacological, immunological and virological outcomes in six to ten EU/EEA countries and fulfill in particular EMA requirements for treatment authorisation. A continuous systematic review and individual patient meta-analysis will summarize all randomized evidence of the interventions for monkeypox. Finally, the project will make sure that acquired knowledge is integrated into public health policies and guidelines and that adequate messages are shared with the general public and high-risk populations with the help of patients’ representatives and associations (WP1-COORDINATE). To accomplish these objectives, MPX-RESPONSE will build on the expertise and networks of multiples partners including Ecraid and EU-RESPONSE and will reinforce and broaden Europe’s capacity to respond rapidly to public health emergencies.

CAPTURING ULTRAFAST ELECTRON AND ION DYNAMICS IN BATTERIES (UltraBat)	Batteries are attractive candidates for lightweight, high capacity, mobile energy storage solutions. Despite decades of research, a persistent fundamental knowledge gap prevents batteries from fulfilling their potential, because the atomistic mechanisms of charge and ion transfer across interfaces in batteries remain largely unexplored by experimental techniques. When charges move, the local arrangement of atoms changes in response to the new electronic configuration. How these changes occur has a significant impact on how efficiently and how far the charges can move, yet the time and length scales are still poorly understood. Conventional experimental probes used in battery research cannot provide the needed ultrafast time and atomic length scale resolution, nor sensitivity to changes in electronic configuration around specific atomic species. Hence, it is currently challenging to unravel the dynamic rearrangement of atoms and ions which accompany electron transfer, and in turn govern the charge transfer processes. UltraBat will close this knowledge gap by pushing further the latest development of ultra-bright and ultra-fast X-ray Free Electron Laser (XFEL) scattering and spectroscopy techniques together with visible ultrafast spectroscopy to study charge transfer between different redox centres in Li-rich layered intercalation compounds and at the solid/liquid interface. Advances in NMR spectroscopy will reveal local ordering and lithium interfacial dynamics on the nanometer scale. Coupled with predictions of experimental observables from a new framework for atomic-scale simulations of the electrochemical interface and transport mechanisms, we will reveal phenomena driving diffusion of ions in complex electrode materials. This will provide the insight required for transformational approaches to control the redox reactions (e.g. electron transfer) that are common to many energy-related processes, including batteries, photovoltaics, and water-splitting systems.

Improving understanding of lung immunity in tuberculosis to establish a diverse, innovative TB vaccine pipeline targeting mucosal immunity (TBVAC-HORIZON)	Tuberculosis (TB) remains one of the most devastating infectious diseases worldwide, killing over 4,000 people every day. Prevention of tuberculosis infection by novel vaccines would provide the most cost-effective approach to achieve the goals of the WHO End TB strategy and the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations. While there are few promising TB vaccine candidates available, innovation by new platforms and strategies is needed to ensure that the most effective and affordable vaccines are developed. TBVACHORIZON will innovate and diversify the global TB vaccine pipeline by pursuing four objectives: 1. Define the composition, spatial organisation and functioning of protective immune responses in the Mycobacterium tuberculosis-infected lung. 2. Evaluate whether mucosal re-vaccination with BCG and other live attenuated vaccines improves protective efficacy against tuberculosis infection in mice, non-human primates and humans. 3. Identify host immune response profiles and biomarkers of natural and vaccine-induced immune protection in the lung. 4. Support next generation TB vaccine development by standardised head-to-head testing of selected vaccine candidates in animals and the establishment of novel delivery systems, adjuvant formulations and GMP platforms for live attenuated vaccines. TBVACHORIZON will increase our understanding and develop tools pertaining to immune protection in the lung, the major site of tuberculosis infection. This knowledge will be exploited to develop mucosal strategies for translating towards clinical evaluation and possible implementation. The interwoven activities will consolidate Europe’s leading role in TB vaccine research and innovation, with the ultimate goal of accelerated availability of affordable, accessible and more effective TB vaccines.

Next-generation models and genetic therapies for rare neuromuscular diseases (MAGIC)	Muscular dystrophies are severe genetic disorders characterised by muscle wasting, impaired mobility and premature death, which to date remain incurable. Although preclinical and clinical evidence position genetic therapies amongst the key emerging treatments for several genetic conditions, no gene therapy or genome editing strategy has been approved for any muscular dystrophies yet. The lack of robust, human(ised) models enabling precise development of such advanced therapies is a major barrier towards their clinical translation for muscle diseases. To overcome this limitation, we have assembled the multidisciplinary MAGIC consortium to build novel, high-fidelity, models of human skeletal muscle pathophysiology which will be used to develop new vectors for safe and efficacious neuromuscular gene therapy and genome editing. Specific rare (paediatric) diseases targeted by our consortium are Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), X-linked centronuclear myopathy (XLCNM), LMNA- and COL6-related congenital muscular dystrophies (CMDs). Microfabrication, microfluidics and human stem cell differentiation technologies will be used to generate disease-specific muscle-on-chip devices qualified for commercialisation, capable of screening toxicity and cell-specificity of new adeno-associated viral vector (AAV) capsid variants, and unique muscle-specific lentiviruses. Selected vectors will be equipped with novel lineage-specific regulatory elements to further restrict transgene expression to myofibres, muscle stem cells or interstitial fibroblasts, reducing also potential immunogenicity. The same vectors will be loaded with therapeutic genes or with new mutationindependent (for DMD and XLCNM) or mutation-specific (for LMNA- and COL6-CMD) gene editing tools, which will then be validated in dystrophic rodents. Finally, GMP-compatible batches of the top performing vectors will undergo advanced preclinical testing in large animals, preparing them for future clinical translation.

A EUROPEAN MULTI-DISCIPLINARY CLINICAL PROJECT MEANT TO IMPROVE THE MANAGEMENT OF PATIENTS WITH POOR PROGNOSTIC OVARIAN CANCER AFTER NEOADJUVANT CHEMOTHERAPY: RESTORING HOPE, SALVAGING LIVES (SALVOVAR)	The standard medical-and-surgical treatment of ovarian carcinoma patients relies on a systemic chemotherapy (carboplatin-paclitaxel), a tumor debulking surgery meant to be complete (no post-operative residual lesion), and a subsequent maintenance treatment with modern targeted agents. Recent studies identified a patient population (~14,000 patients / year in Europe), whose prognostic is poor (5 year-overall survival (OS) <20%) due to a refractory cancer, characterized by a poor chemosensitivity (assessable online with the numeric CA-125 KELIMTM score <1.0), and by a disease found non-resectable disease after 3-4 cycles of chemotherapy. In these patients, there is a high uncertainty about the best treatment adjustments to apply. SALVOVAR is a European project led by HCL, meant 1) to raise the physician awareness, and propose practical and affordable diagnostic tools for identifying these patients, and 2) to assess the utility (OS benefit), acceptability (quality-of-life; patient perception) and affordability (cost-effectiveness, including country coverage policies) of solutions based on adjustments of their medical-and-surgical treatment. These solutions implementable in routine may improve their prognosis, according to recent literature data. The project will be based on a large pragmatic randomized phase III trial, sponsored by ARCAGY-GINECO group, and activated in 6 countries (ENGOT network; ~100 recruiting centers), with the objective of demonstrating an OS benefit with the chemotherapy densification (weekly carboplatine-paclitaxel dose-dense regimen) compared to the continuation of the standard 3-weekly regimen. Total 685 patients treated with the standard neo-adjuvant chemotherapy will be pre-screened to randomize 240 patients. Dissemination, and communication will be carried-on to ensure the quality of the project, and inform the stakeholders, patients, public, health authorities/ payers of the project outcomes, mean to change the practices. This action is part of the Cancer Mission cluster of projects on ‘Diagnosis and treatment’.

Pragmatic approach to Adoptive Cell Therapy (ACT) using Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes (TIL) in selected solid tumors (PragmaTIL)	The PragmaTIL trial aims to optimize treatment of cancer patients with Tumour-Infiltrating Lymphocytes Adoptive Cell Therapy (TIL-ACT) and substantially expand and improve the clinical implementation of this treatment modality in academic hospitals. To this end, treatment related toxicities, associated to high-dose interleukin 2 (HD-IL-2) required for expansion and activation of TILs will be reduced while maintaining efficacy. This improved tolerability will achieve a better clinical management of patients and enhance their quality of life, both of which represent major barriers for applying this treatment. The objectives of PragmaTIL are: i) To determine whether TIL-ACT using IL-2 analog ANV419 reduces the frequency of Grade 2-4 study-related non-hematological toxicities; ii) To compare the quality of life (QoL) of patients during their hospitalization period, using ANV419 vs HD-IL-2. Also, to compare short and long-term measurements of treatment-related toxicities and QoL co-defined by and for patients and their caregivers; and iii) To develop the health technology assessment (HTA) of TIL-ACT using ANV419, as well as a social return of investment (SROI) analysis. To achieve these objectives, the PragmaTIL project is structured into 6 WP that cover all the requirements to implement the project: WP1) Clinical Trial; WP2) IMPD Coordination, RA and Pharmacovigilance; WP3) Patients as co-researchers and Evaluation of Short- and Long-term PROs; WP4) Health Economics; WP5) SROI, Sustainability and Exploitation; WP6) Scientific Coordination, Project Management, Communication and Dissemination. The global impact of this project will not only reach patients, clinical and translational researchers and policy makers but may help to achieve a better acceptance of these therapies by society at large.

Assessing Climate Change Risk in EUrope (ACCREU)	ACCREU will contribute to the just transition towards climate resilience in the EU, its Member States, and regions, by co-creating and co-delivering with a wide array of stakeholders, new knowledge and actionable insights that connect the challenges of adaptation and mitigation with the multiple and new challenges our society is facing. At the scientific level, it will provide a comprehensive, integrated, co-created, socio-economic evaluation of future climate risk under different adaptation and mitigation scenarios, across European countries, sectors, households, and business types. Specific attention will be paid to non-market impacts on biodiversity, ecosystems, and health. ACCREU will advance models and methods for climate risk assessment, and integrated adaptation decision-making. Novel investigations will be developed to assess poverty, equity, financial, and fiscal implications of climate risk and the related policies. At the societal/economic level, ACCREU will engage stakeholders involved in different adaptation decision types to design practical solutions to successfully mainstream climate resilience and adaptation into decision-making processes. ACCREU’s case studies will examine adaptation decisions in the following thematic areas: risk assessment, ecosystems and nature-based solutions, land use and food systems, water management, protection and management of critical infrastructures including transport and supply chains, health, and human well-being, and justice. Stakeholders will represent decision makers at the local (e.g. city or municipal authorities, local resource managers), national/regional (e.g. regional and national authorities), and pan European level (e.g. EEA, EIB). Some case studies will be pan-European whereas some other case studies will be carried out in Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, Germany, Sweden, United Kingdom. To ensure effective uptake and long-term use of its results, the co-designed applied case studies will involve EU-level stakeholders, such as Directorate-Generals, the JRC, the EEA, the Mission Adaptation, as well as local practitioners, businesses, and authorities.

Novel immunotherapies for tuberculosis and other mycobacterial diseases (ITHEMYC)	Tuberculosis (TB) remains the leading cause of death due to a single pathogen, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb; except in 2020-2022, when it was surpassed by the COVID-19 pandemic), with 1.5 million deaths in 2020. The lengthy TB treatment and the numerous adverse events contribute to poor medical adherence and development of antibiotic resistant strains. Thus, novel therapeutic modalities are urgently needed to shorten treatment duration, improve outcomes and control the emergence of drug resistant TB. The ITHEMYC project convenes a multidisciplinary consortium of 11 partners, including two Product Development Partnerships (TBVI, TB-Alliance) and an industrial partner (GSK) involved in vaccine, drug and biomarker R&D for TB. The partners will work jointly to develop innovative adjunctive TB immunotherapies by capitalizing on a promising pipeline and recent developments in the field. The project will combine current and new antibiotic regimens with novel immunotherapies, such as small molecules targeting host pathogen-interactions, including host-directed therapies and virulence inhibitors, immunomodulatory compounds, monoclonal antibodies and therapeutic vaccines. The project will generate robust preclinical safety and efficacy information on compounds and combinations through a set of relevant in vitro, in vivo and in silico models, and progress two of them up to preclinical proof-of-concept in non-human primates within the project duration. The partners are proposing a critical path for characterization and progression of immunotherapies, that will be refined based on knowledge generated in ITHEMYC aiming to increase the understanding and interest for this emerging concept of adjunctive TB immunotherapy. We expect the new combined interventions will improve TB cure rates, reduce the duration and toxicity of current regimens and reduce relapse rates.

Optimising a High Efficacy Plasmodium vivax Malaria Vaccine (OptiViVax)	Plasmodium vivax is the most widespread human malaria with 2.5 billion people living at risk in South America, Oceania and Asia. The revised Malaria Vaccine Technology Roadmap to 2030 recognises the severity of P. vivax malaria, calling for a vaccine intervention to achieve 75% efficacy over two years, now equally weighted with P. falciparum. However, if this ambition is to be realised, new and innovative approaches are urgently required to accelerate next-generation vaccine research and development, whilst the few known candidate antigens need to undergo early-phase clinical assessment. Here, we build on exciting breakthroughs in P. vivax vaccine research, recently pioneered in Europe, including new transgenic parasite technologies for functional assay development and production of a parasite clone that is safe for use in controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) clinical models. The Objectives of OptiViVax will now integrate ambitious multi-disciplinary scientific and clinical approaches around the parasite’s lifecycle and will use our increased knowledge of P. vivax immuno-biology to further develop next-generation vaccines with improved efficacy. We will diversify the portfolio of new antigens ready for clinical testing by reverse vaccinology and diversify their delivery with new platforms and adjuvants developed using sustainable and improved GMP bio-manufacturing know-how. In parallel, the efficacy of known leading antigens will be benchmarked for the first time using innovative design of clinical studies and CHMI models making these lead candidate vaccines ready for future field trials. Improved preclinical functional assays, using state-of-the-art transgenic parasite lines, will also allow for mechanisms of antibody-mediated protection to be deciphered. The availability of new functional assays and human challenge models will underpin the future framework for informed decision making by the clinical vaccine community, policy makers, funders and regulators.

Therapies for Renal Ciliopathies (TheRaCil)	Ciliopathies are a large group of rare and severe genetic diseases caused by dysfunction of the primary cilium, a microtubule-based cell surface antenna that controls key signaling output required during development and tissue homeostasis. Cilium dysfunction leads to complex disorders with high genetic heterogeneity and overlapping phenotypes. Despite the broad clinical spectrum, chronic kidney disease (CKD) leading to end stage kidney disease (ESKD) is a common cause of morbidity across ciliopathies. Currently, the only available standard of care for CKD is based on dialysis and transplantation. Renal ciliopathies represent a main cause of ESKD during childhood and despite the identification of more than 40 causative genes, it remains difficult to predict the severity of the disease as well as the risk of appearance (if not present at diagnosis) and the rate of progression of renal failure. TheRaCil therefore aims: (1) to improve diagnosis and prognosis of at risk pediatric renal ciliopathy patients, and (2) to implement therapeutic approaches aimed at targeting shared pathological pathways, at modifying mRNA targets of the causative or modifier genes by antisense oligonucleotides and by the repurposing of available molecules. These goals will be achieved through the federation of our unique databases of pediatric renal ciliopathies cases available across Europe, which will allow a better stratification of patients, the identification of modifier genes and markers of disease progression. Bioinformatics approaches will be used to integrate patients’ biological and genetic data as well as multi-omics and functional analyses from patients samples and preclinical models. These analyses should lead to the identification of shared targetable pathological pathways as well as of patients eligible for the identified new therapeutic approaches which will be evaluated in robust preclinical models.	ciliopathies, chronic kidney disease, antisense oligonucleotides, modifiers, personalised medicine, AI technology, preclinical models, patient centered outcomes, NPH, ARPKD, clinical trial readiness	IMAGINE INSTITUT DES MALADIES GENETIQUES NECKER ENFANTS MALADES FONDATION	RUPRECHT-KARLS-UNIVERSITAET HEIDELBERG, KLINIKUM DER UNIVERSITAET ZU KOELN, UNIVERSITAIR MEDISCH CENTRUM UTRECHT, ASSISTANCE PUBLIQUE HOPITAUX DE PARIS, WESTFAELISCHE WILHELMS-UNIVERSITAET MUENSTER, KOBENHAVNS UNIVERSITET, INSTITUT NATIONAL DE LA SANTE ET DE LA RECHERCHE MEDICALE, MEDETIA SAS, STICHTING RADBOUD UNIVERSITAIR MEDISCH CENTRUM, UNIVERSITATSKLINIKUM HEIDELBERG, BERGMANN CARSTEN, OSPEDALE SAN RAFFAELE SRL	https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101080717/program/43108390/details
